The management of local genetic resources implies the development of the possibilities. This requires that the producers be involved. However, they are not a homogeneous group and their goals vary greatly. The Thones and Marthod sheep husbandry, in Savoia (a French alpine area), is a good example. This hairy breed of sheep is very useful for range management, but its carcass has no value. Its survival can be explained by the local economy, as two-thirds of the Savoian peasants are part-time farmers. Such a pluriactivity allows these smallholders to keep a few ewes as currency. As well, some breeders rear flocks for commercial crossing and others have started dairy farming. This diversity has led the local association of sheep owners to consider the best way to organise and exchange. Thus, an adaptive, participatory research was launched to provide them with useful data. The demographic study of this endangered breed was completed by a sociological survey, as it is essential to understand the criteria and practices of the various producers. Although acting in distinctive ways, these farmers form a network that could be developed. Provided they would not be compelled to integrate a pyramidal system, they would be interested in improving ram exchanges through a kind of stud. It would be a very open system, each stock farmer will get the opportunity to become a breeder. It does not aim at a selection scheme but rather a social, organisational process which would allow the breeders to adapt the management of the breed in a sustainable way. Thus, the fact that these breeders reject integration does not necessarily mean they do not approve of partnership.

Participants were recruited through posted announcements in three methadone clinics in Harlem, New York City. Individuals were considered eligible if they, were enrolled as patients in one of the clinics for at least three months. A social network questionnaire modeled after the General Social Survey network section was developed by the investigators. Face-to-face interviews were conducted by trained interviewers and included demographics, drug use, self-reported HIV statics of the woman and her network members, and the social network structures. Univariate analyses found that HIV-positive and HIV-negative women had different network profiles. HIV-positive women were more likely to associate with a higher number of current drug users, injection drug users, injection drug users who were HIV-positive, drug partners, drug partners who used injection drugs, and drug partners who were HIV-positive. Multivariate analyses indicated that HIV-positive respondents were more likely to associate with HIV-positive network members than their HIV-negative counterparts.;The findings suggest that to better understand the spread of HIV among female drug users and to design more effective HIV/AIDS prevention programmes, efforts should move beyond focusing on individual attributes to address the contextual dynamics of social networks.

The purpose of this article is to describe a model mobile HIV program, highlighting its flexibility in providing services to clients who infrequently present to traditional clinic-based testing sites. This mobile HIV program was developed to provide on-site HIV testing and counseling, education, and linkages to primary care services. The implementation of the program begins with training of agency staff, who then provide preliminary orientation with clients regarding HIV testing. Approximately 3 weeks later, the mobile program staff (HIV nurse specialist and HIV counselors) provide standardized group pretest counseling and education. Clients who decide to be tested meet with mobile program staff for individualized risk assessment and specimen collection. Two weeks later, clients meet with mobile program staff to obtain results and receive posttest counseling; risk reduction strategies are reemphasized at that time. Unique to this program is the provision of referrals for a wide range of primary care services for both seropositive and seronegative clients. Since 1994, the mobile program has been implemented at six sites, and over 1100 clients have been served. Two major outcomes from the program have been observed: 1. With adequate preparation and psychological support, 40% of hard-to-reach populations will elect to be HIV tested. 2. Through social networks of program participants, HIV-positive individuals not previously engaged in care have been referred to a comprehensive HIV primary care program.

The experiences of many African-American women, however, suggest that the spatial-entrapment thesis requires refinement. I argue that the spatial-entrapment thesis is based on a problematic conceptualization of the links between space and power in people's daily lives, one that equates immobility with powerlessness and mobility with power. The thesis not only theorizes power as unidirectional (i.e., more power, more mobility), it also masks important differences among women by undertheorizing mobility and immobility relative to social relations other than gender, such as "race." I argue that, depending on the constellation of power relations, the spatial boundedness of women's lives is a potential resource for, as well as a constraint on, their economic security. The utility of this reconceptualization of the links between space and power for examining the opportunities for and barriers to women's economic security is demonstrated through an analysis of the role of place-based personal networks in the survival strategies of working poor African-American and white women with children in Worcester, Massachusetts. I first evaluate these women's experiences in terms of the spatial-entrapment thesis. Then I examine whether women's use of spatial rootedness in the construction of their survival strategies can be enabling as well as constraining. The results confirm that the spatial boundedness of women's daily lives and their survival strategies are mutually constituted; that is, place-based personal networks are an important component of survival strategies, and can be both enabling and constraining, depending on how racism structures women's experiences.

An interpretivist approach and qualitative research methods were used in the study design. Nineteen vegetarians from a metropolitan area in Western New York State were purposefully recruited using snowball sampling to participate in in-depth interviews. Respondents varied in age, gender and type and duration of vegetarian diet, although the sample was predominantly middle-aged, middle-class and female and had ties to community groups. Interview transcripts were analyzed using the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis. The maintenance of vegetarian diets was supported by personal factors, social networks and environmental resources. Personal factors included: internal beliefs, skills and habits and physical feedback. Social networks included: organized vegetarian groups as well as animal rights, environmental, or health groups supporting vegetarianism and vegetarian friends. Environmental resources, such as the availability of new vegetarian foods in supermarkets and restaurants, facilitated maintenance of vegetarian diets. Respondents perceived that society viewed vegetarianism as increasingly "mainstream," although diet-centred family conflicts were still common. These findings can assist dietitians in developing strategies for working with vegetarian clients by providing better understanding of personal, social and environmental supports for vegetarians' dietary behaviours.

Design: Semistructured interview with amputees in their home setting. Setting: Residential home for war veteran amputees or respondents' own homes. Patients: Amputee veterans of World War II with phantom pain. Outcome Measures: pain (McGill Pain Questionnaire) and pain history, coping (daily coping; Stone and Neale, J Pers Soc Psychol 1984;46:892-906), size of social network, and quality of war memories. Results: No differences in pain or coping were associated with place of residence (and prevalence of cues) or social networks; war memories appeared not to be associated with availability of cues, whether media coverage or other amputees. There was some association between the emotional tone of war memories and pain intensity. Veteran amputees were in general accepting of high levels of pain and made little use of medical resources, relating that to past experience of their pain being dismissed. Conclusion: Coping with phantom pain in war veteran amputees is predominantly silent acceptance of the pain, with little use of social support however available, and rare recourse to medical help, based on past unhelpful experience. Pain and mood appeared to be unrelated to specific war cues, but higher pain scores were reported by those with unhappier war memories.

In both studies clients assigned to ACT teams reported having more professionals in their social networks than clients assigned to the other treatments. Clients did not report significant differences between treatment conditions on most of the other social relationship dimensions. Further attention to developing social skills and network interventions within ACT teams are recommended.

The traditional explanation for emigration - overpopulation-is dismissed. During the process of population growth, local social networks became more close-meshed and inegalitarian. Transatlantic migration was, however, not undertaken solely by the poor or by victims of the local oligarchy. Loose-knit transatlantic networks provided information on opportunities in America which made emigration an option for all social strata. It is suggested that networks provide a more useful context for the understanding of emigration than territorial demographic and economic systems, and that the workings of networks can be both positive and negative.

However, it is by no means obvious that the state has the ability to impose its will concerning technical change on the other relevant actors. Therefore, we conceptualize power in a non-linear model with social conflict and induced technical change. The model shows how economic growth, business cycles and innovation waves interact in the dynamics of energy efficiency. We assess three different ways of government control: energy taxes, energy and labor subsidies, and energy caps. Energy taxes help to select more energy efficient technologies. However, a successful selection of such technologies presupposes that they are available in the pool of technologies. As for energy subsidies, their existence helps to explain why in contemporary economies labor productivity grows faster than energy efficiency. With an energy cap, the social network of the relevant agents may be stabilized via social norms. It seems plausible that innovation waves comprise several business cycles and that such a wave is currently in the making. Proposals to postpone policies for improving energy efficiency increase the risk of energy inefficient lock-in effects. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The study included (A) all residents in new sheltered housing facilities (response rate 68%, n = 102), (B) a random sample of users of home care (response rate 67%, n = 435), and (C) a random sample of individuals not using home cars (response rate 74%, n = 501). All participants were 60 + years old. Data were collected by personal interviews (group A) and by postal questionnaires (group B and C). Functional ability was measured by The Avlund Mob-T scale about tiredness related to mobility and the Mob-H scale about need of help to mobility. Both scales were able to distinguish the three sub-populations. The whole range of the Mob-T scale was used in all three subpopulations, and the whole range of the Mob-H scale was used among the oldest residents and the oldest users of home care. A small group of well-functioning users of home care (n = 52) was characterized by good self-rated health, good hearing, vision and memory abilities; they gave more help to others, had higher social participation, and lived alone (only the women). A somewhat lager group of poor functioning non-users of home care (n = 266) had the opposite characteristics. In addition, they were older, had a poor social network and poor social support.

Older children's reports of less parental support are consistent with expectations of diminishing attachment. However, the relative importance of same sex friends for provision of support for girls, in comparison to boys, suggests more flexibility in the sense of their being less tied to parents for support. The comparison between children from different family types revealed no differences in respect of relations with same sex or opposite sex friends. Hence, no compensation or spill over from parental separation was evident. However, there was a clear system effect in that children from divorcing families that lived with their mother provided relatively more support for mother, and also reported less acceptance from their fathers in comparison to those children where no pal-ental separation had taken place. Their adjustment will depend at least in part, on the functioning of their broader social networks.

It is hypothesized that the duration of a socially severe disease will affect the social network in such a way that the proportions of women, kin, long-standing relationships and people living nearby are higher for people suffering from a disease longer. Contacts with colleagues will decline. Methods: These hypotheses were tested on the data of a representative sample of the Dutch, gathered by means of a health interview (N=10,110). The presence and duration of diseases were measured by a checklist of 23 chronic diseases. The social severity of a disease was determined by its visibility, threat to others and functional disablement, The network characteristics in this study were church membership, membership of voluntary organizations, number of close friends, number of supportgivers, proportions of kin, women, colleagues, long-standing relationships and people living nearby. Gender, education, life-cycle stage and work status were taken into account in all analyses. Results: Logistic and linear regression analyses showed that the duration of a disease, whatever the degree of social severity, does not affect the network strongly. People suffering longer from socially severe chronic diseases reported fewer friends and supportgivers, People suffering longer from moderately severe chronic diseases reported fewer supportgivers for health-related support. The results on socially mild chronic diseases were not in line with the expectations: people who are ill longer reported more friends and fewer women in their network. Conclusion: We conclude that in a general population the duration of diseases hardly has any effect on social network characteristics.

Economic development patterns and the three main models of corporate structure - Anglo-Saxon, Continental European, and Japanese - are discussed. On the basis of an analysis of the network of director interlocks among the 100 largest industrial corporations, 50 largest banks and 30 largest insurance companies in 1993, I conclude that Spain approximates the Continental European model. Three main findings result from this analysis: (1) Spanish domestic banks coupled with utility companies are located at the core of the intercorporate network; (2) capital-intensive industrial corporations belong to the inner circle of the network, while foreign-owned and light industry enterprises are isolates in the network; and (3) directorship interlocks in Spain tend to take place across industrial sectors rather than within them. I argue that bank-led economic development, high state intervention, and delayed but intensive foreign capital penetration explain the three corporate network outcomes. By combining historical-structuralism and social-network analysis, this study contributes a new empirical case to the existing literature, showing how historical structural factors help to explain intercorporate relations.

The main characteristic of the cost function is that output categories are classified in terms of movements between different health states. These were measured by changes in activities of daily living (ADL) over 2 years, with 'low' ADL representing better functional ability than 'high' ADL. Empirical application of the approach, using four states defined in terms of worsening progression (stable low ADL; deteriorated or improved ADL; stable high ADL; deceased), indicated more favourable states were associated with lower costs. Multivariate analysis showed that the derived states were significantly related to costs which, when combined with variables indicating presence of particular chronic health conditions (diabetes or previous stroke), admission to continuing care accommodation and household structure, explained one-fifth of the variation in log average costs per week. Variables such as age, sex, carer input, social networks and level of cognitive functioning had no independent impact on costs. These findings could be used as a starting point for those interested in predicting the cost implications associated with the ageing population. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Patients' social networks and social support may impact on their utilisation of psychiatric services. This literature review focuses on social networks, social support and mental health service use in patients with mental illness. Most studies suggest that smaller social networks or less social support are associated with more frequent hospitalisation. Qualitative aspects of the social network are also related to the risk of hospitalisation. The relationship between social networks and other types of service use is not established.

Language diversity generally increases as one moves from the poles toward the equator and is very low in arid environments. Two belts of extremely high language diversity can be identified. One runs through West and Central Africa, while the other covers South and South-East Asia and the Pacific. Most of the world's languages are found in these two areas. This paper attempts to explain aspects of the global distribution of language diversity. It is proposed that a key factor influencing it has been climatic variability. Where the climate allows continuous food production throughout the year, small groups of people can be reliably self-sufficient and so populations fragment into many small languages. Where the variability of the climate is greater, the size of social network necessary for reliable subsistence is larger, and so languages tend to be more widespread. A regression analysis relating the number of languages spoken in the major tropical countries to the variability of their climates is performed and the results support the hypothesis. The geographical patterning of languages has, however, begun to be destroyed by the spread of Eurasian diseases, Eurasian people, and the world economy. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

In the American Southwest the study of exchange networks, and Particularly of ceramic exchange, has taken a central place in archaeological research that aims at reconstructing changing patterns of community interaction and sociopolitical organization in prehistoric Southwestern societies. This article examines recent models and methods far reconstructing exchange and presents criteria for defining material correlates of the diverse mechanisms of ceramic circulation present in the northern Southwest during the late Pueble III and Pueblo IV periods (A.D. 1250-1450).

Although multiple production centers are recognized for these decorated vessels, their roles in intraregional social networks are still open to interpretation. Recent compositional studies using petrography and weak-acid extraction ICP-MS compare locally produced wares to the characterization of Salado polychromes. Data from several adjacent study areas are used to assess the development and distributions of Pinto, Gila, and Tonto Polychromes. These decorated vessels are evidence of a highly differentiated intraregional network of exchange and communication which spanned the platform mound communities of central Arizona.

Findings suggest an "embeddedness" of market place activity in the social networks of the rural communities, The number and purchasing power of older persons offer opportunities to rural businesses who are alert to the concerns and unmet needs of these consumers.

The adolescents in our studies have taught us a number of lessons about studying personal relationships. We use examples from our research to illustrate these lessons and discuss their implications for studying adult, as well as adolescent, relationships. In particular, adolescents have taught us to recognize the multileveled nature of networks and to distinguish among the interactional, dyadic relationship, group and overall levels of networks. The diversity of adolescent relationships presents researchers with the methodological and conceptual challenge of identifying and taking into account the similarities and differences among relationships. Research with adolescents also makes one appreciate the developmental transformations that relationships undergo. We describe changes in the absolute level and relative level of characteristics, the stability and centrality of characteristics, and their structure. We discuss implications of the idea that development occurs at the individual level, and distinguish between developmental trajectories and the timing of such trajectories.

The results of a study by Jylha & Jokela (1990) showed that loneliness was more prevalent in regions of Europe where living alone was rarest and where community bonds were strongest. This inverse macro-level association, an increasing proportion of lonely older people and a decreasing proportion of older people who live alone from northern to southern Europe, could not be explained by differences in individual social integration. The aim of the present study was to reinvestigate this association. The data were from surveys conducted in the Netherlands (N = 3750) and northwestern Tuscany, Italy (N = 1543). Fewer older adults lived alone in Tuscany than in the Netherlands, which indicates that the Dutch were less integrated. As regards their participation in social organizations and personal networks, the Tuscan older adults were less integrated. To a large extent, loneliness among the Dutch and Tuscans based on differences in social integration could be similarly explained, and regional loneliness differences could be attributed to individual situations and characteristics.

The study replicates the open-ended survey approach used by Dainton & St-afford (1993) to explore the maintenance behaviors of heterosexual couples. In general, gay and lesbian partners were found to utilize many of the same basic maintenance behaviors that have been found in prior research on heterosexual couples. Importantly, several 'unique' maintenance behaviors emerged, such as being 'out' as a couple to one's social networks and seeking out gay/lesbian supportive environments as a means of strengthening the relationship in the face of social stigma. These behaviors appear to take on particular salience for gay and lesbian couples as a stigmatized group in maintaining their intimate relationships. In general, the findings question common assumptions as to differences between same-sex and heterosexual long-term relationships.

We hypothesized that the greater the number of people who share a given social structural location and the more access they have to situations where it is possible to meet new people, the less likely they are to have problematic friendships. The sample comprised 53 male and female community residents aged 55 to 84 years who enjoyed fairly good health. Logistic and multiple regression procedures revealed outcomes opposite to our predictions: those who were supposedly more social structurally advantaged actually reported greater numbers of problematic friendships. potential interpretations include the possibility that these people are more critical than others of their friend relationships or more willing to acknowledge problems, that the norms regarding commitment to friends are weaker among these individuals, or that they learn to acquire friends but not to avoid and solve problems in their relationships. Apparently. people with more friends are not mart: likely than others to terminate problematic friendships or to redefine them as mere associations.

This study examined the relations between predictors and indicators of Granovetter's 1973 construct of tie strength. Marsden and Campbell's 1984 finding of "contamination" of indicators by predictors is supported by this analysis.

L. Carstensen's (1993, 1995) socioemotional selectivity theory within and across three cohorts spanning 4 decades. Socioemotional selectivity theory predicts that as individuals age, they narrow their social networks to devote more emotional resources to fewer relationships with close friends and family Data from 3 cohorts of nationally representative samples were analyzed to determine whether respondents' satisfaction with the size of their social networks differed by age, cohort, or both. Results support socioemotional selectivity theory: More older adults than younger adults were satisfied with the current size of their social networks rather than wanting larger networks. These findings are consistent across all cohorts. Results are discussed with respect to social relationships across the Life course.

The model is based on recent developments in means - end chain theory. A paper-and-pencil laddering methodology is applied to collect data among 231 customers in Austria concerning their desire expectations about service employees of clothing stores. Additive tree and social network analyses reveal three orientations in customer desire expectations, covering the process, outcome, and relational aspects of service encounters. Meanings within orientations are mutually linked and hierarchically organized from desire expectations about specific service employees' behaviors, via customer goal attainments and feelings, to behavioral responses. Implications for service marketing theory and practice are offered. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In addition, the importance of social networks in the presence of chronic stress remains unclear. We examined the association between social networks and aspects of mental functioning (mental health, vitality and role-emotional functioning) and the relationship between social networks and mental functioning in the presence of stressors. Multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to examine data in 47,912 middle-aged and older healthy women. The Medical Outcomes Study Short-form Health Survey measured dimensions of quality of life. We observed strong associations between levels of social networks and multivariate-adjusted quality of life scores, particularly in potentially high stress situations. Compared to the most socially integrated, women who were socially isolated had reductions in mental health and vitality scores of 6.5 and 7.4 points, respectively and a 60% increased risk of limitation in role-emotional functioning. Social networks are positively associated with mental functioning in women. This association is strongest for women reporting high levels of home and work stressors.

The present analysis was undertaken in order to investigate a broader set of possible explanatory factors in another cohort of Swedish men. Study population and methods: Occupation was coded into five occupational classes for 717 of 776 participant men from a random population sample of 1016 men who were born in 1933. All were living in Goteborg and were 50 years old at the baseline examination. After 12 years' follow-up, 68 of the 717 men had died (9.5%). Results: Low occupational class was associated with a higher prevalence of smoking at baseline, but no association was found with systolic blood pressure, body mass index, waist to hip ratio, serum triglycerides or serum cholesterol. Subjects from higher socioeconomic strata were taller, had higher maximum peak respiratory flow, lower plasma fibrinogen and lower body temperature. Low occupational class was associated with low social integration, low home activity levels, low levels of activity outside home and low social activity levels (p=0.001 for all) and with low emotional support (p=0.018). There were also associations between low occupational class and poor self-perceived health, as well as with several cardiovascular symptoms. During 12 years' follow-up, there was a graded and inverse relationship between occupational class and mortality from all causes. The highest mortality was found among the men who could not be classified (23 per 1,000 person years) Of the men in the lowest occupational class, 12 per 1,000 died, compared to 3 per 1,000 in the highest class (relative risk 3.7 (1.4-9.8)). After controlling for smoking, the relative risk decreased to 3.2 (1.2-8.6) and after further adjustment for emotional support, self-perceived health, activity level at home, and peak expiratory flow, the relative risk was still twofold but not significantly so (RR 2.1 (0.8-5.8)). Conclusion: We were able to confirm earlier results as to the wide mortality differentials in urban middle-aged men in Sweden. There were also large differences in several other factors, including constitutional factors, health variables, lifestyle and social support indices, which explained important parts of the social mortality gradient, the most prominent being smoking, respiratory function, social network factors and subjective health.

A core idea of the theory is that musical forms depend on people for their existence. The theory argues that people are a resource for types of music; musical forms compete for the time, energy, and preferences of individuals. Musical types carve out niches in different sociodemographic segments of society. According to the theory, the niche pattern develops because musical Preferences are transmitted through homophilous social network ties; similar people interact with each other and develop similar musical tastes. The article develops six hypotheses that relate individuals' social positions to their musical preferences, Tests with 1993 General Social Survey data support these hypotheses.

Changes in the community context of historical African American migration	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article							RATES; VIOLENCE	This article analyzes changes in the significance of African American ethnogenesis on the contrasting flows of young migrants and total migrants to urban areas throughout the United States. I test a destination migration model during the two decades 1930-40 and 1950-60. Because of the temporal and spatial dependency among the urban counties, I use seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) to estimate simultaneously the coefficients across the two periods. By focusing on the characteristics of urban destinations, the article goes beyond most previous work that considers only the characteristics of places of origin. By examining two distinct time periods, various period effects are also appropriately considered. The results support the significance of ethnogenesis, or the establishment of ''social networks and communication patterns as the bases of ... institutional and communal life" (Taylor 1979:1405), in shaping the historical migration of African Americans. However due in part to this very ethnogenic activity, over time the relative risks of mobility for prospective migrants were gradually reduced as the migration itself became a social movement. Many of the factors that previously conditioned the migration declined in their significance, leading to reduced dynamism of the migration process.

This exploratory analysis addresses the questions: 1) Who among the members of the social network of a person diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder is likely to become a target of violence?; 2) What kind of relationships do targets have with respondents in terms of the quality and quantity of interactions?, and 3) What are the risk factors that contribute to being a target of violence for people who are in the social networks of persons with serious mental disorders? The samples of 169 people with serious mental disorders were followed for 30 months. A logistic regression model of the risk for being a target of violence among the members of the cohort's social network reveals that both target and respondent characteristics are salient, and that mothers who live with adult children who have schizophrenia and co-occurring substance abuse bear a substantially elevated risk of becoming a target of violence, compared to other social network members. Other factors that elevate the risk for being a target of violence are being an immediate family members of the respondent, more time in residence with the respondent, and whether the respondent is financially dependent on the family. Respondents with the most mental health center visits had lower odds of committing an act or threat of violence against a social network member.

The analysis is directed at the question of how a patient and a social network respond to each other during the dementia process. The diary highlights features in the development of the dementia process which receive scant attention in empirical studies: changes in the interaction process between patient and social network; a patient's residual capacities; a caregiver's perceived rewards of caregiving. We designated three phases in the interaction process: the phase of recognition, the stable phase and the phase of destabilization. This diary illustrates how a stable phase in the interaction between patient and primary caregiver can be established. The caregiver derived rewards by noticing and using the patient's residual capacities and by a feeling of being useful. In this case caregiving is not unidirectional. The quality of future support programmes may be enhanced by combining programmes aimed Lo influence patient's behaviour and to support caregivers. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Results of a representative study	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR GERONTOLOGIE UND GERIATRIE			German	Article						institutionalization; widowhood; aging	NURSING-HOME USE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; CARE; RISK; POPULATION; STATISTICS; FALLACY	In this study the rate of institutionalization in old age for the first time is analyzed on a retrospective data set: the Altenheimsurvey and the Socio-Economic Panel Survey. The study relies on 5,150 persons aged 60 and over. Based on these data, a variety of insufficiently answered questions were analyzed. Among the results, (1) the age increase of the institutionalization rate relies only to a minor extend on declining health and declining social networks, (2) the higher institutionalization rate of women is entirely ascribed to widowhood, and (3) non-familiar social networks are of minor importance.

It is argued that one of the difficulties faced by many of the contingency studies that have addressed this problem is their conceptualisation of accounting. The present study suggests that accounting, as a tool for organisational control, exists not as a collection of techniques, but as on-going processes. As such, the individuals involved with such processes might be expected to play a substantial role in shaping them. Social network analysis forms the basis of an attempt to understand these issues.

Rather, each individual has a fixed circle of acquaintances and the epidemic spreads along this social network. In case the number of initially infective individuals stays small, a branching process approximation for the number of infectives is in force. Moreover, we provide a deterministic approximation of the bivariate process of susceptible and infective individuals, valid when the number of initially infective individuals is large. These results are used in order to derive the basic reproduction number and the asymptotic final epidemic size of the process. The model is described in the framework of random graphs.

To examine whether partner smoking behaviour change is associated with women's smoking reduction and cessation during pregnancy, independently of a range of potential psychosocial confounding variables. It: was hypothesized that a woman's failure to reduce or quit smoking in pregnancy would be associated independently with failure of partner to reduce or quit smoking. Design. Cohort study. Methods. A population-based sample of 662 women who smoked, or had smoked until becoming pregnant, were recruited in early pregnancy, with follow-up in late pregnancy, participants completed questionnaires and self-report measures of psychosocial variables. The primary outcome measures were women's self-reported daily cigarette consumption before pregnancy (retrospective), and during early and late pregnancy (contemporary), from which smoking cessation, reduction and maintenance measures were derived. Results. Seventy per cent of partners smoked, and 25 per cent of all partners (34 per cent of smoking partners) reduced or quitted smoking in early pregnancy. The study hypothesis was confirmed in multivariate logistic regression models. Women's failure to quit smoking in early pregnancy was independently associated with partner failing to reduce or quit smoking, higher number of social network smokers, adult attachment style, socio-economic status, pre-pregnancy cigarette consumption and older age. Women's failure to reduce smoking was independently associated with partner failing to reduce or quit smoking, socio-economic status, pre-pregnancy cigarette consumption, and higher parity. Partner and family emotional support, joint pregnancy planning and depressive symptomatology, were not independently associated with women's smoking reduction or cessation. Follow-up data confirmed the early pregnancy results. Conclusions.

Method In a prospective controlled study, social network data were obtained in an epidemiologically representative sample of people with psychotic disorders both before (Time I) and two years after (Time 2) the introduction of two sectorised community mental health services in south London (one intensive service with two specialist teams, one standard service with a generic team). Results There were significant baseline differences between sectors with social networks being smaller in the sector later served by the intensive service. Social network size increased within the intensive service sector, but not in the standard service sector. There was a significant sector effect for the network component of relatives (intensive > standard) and in the other ('non friends') component (standard > intensive) after adjusting for baseline differences. Conclusions The findings suggest that the intensive sector community mental health service enhanced people's social networks with their relatives, relative to the standard service. The reverse is the case for other contacts.

Method The results presented in the preceding nine papers are interpreted. Results (a)The health and social gains reported in experimental studies of community health services are replicable in ordinary clinical settings, and are more effective than hospital-oriented services which they replace. (b) Dilution does occur - these gains are less pronounced than in experimental (efficacy) studies. (c) Both models of community services produced a range of improved outcomes. (d)Some limited extra advantages tin terms of met needs, improved quality of life, and social networks) were found in the intensive sector. (e) There is no consistent evidence that community-oriented services (which include in-patient beds) fail service users, their families or the wider public. On balance the results weigh slightly in favour of the two-team model (for acute and continuing care) in terms of clinical effectiveness, but the general model is almost as effective and is less expensive. Conclusions The evidence supports a community-oriented rather than a hospital-oriented approach and there is little difference between the community mental health team models.

By using the public as a lens to analyze the social networks that constitute specific systems integral to the shaping of everyday life and attendant informal and formal political institutions, critical choices and alternatives cart be identified by framing questions of communication in terms of political culture. Drawing upon approaches from science and technology studies, cultural studies, and communication studies, this project is a comparative analysis of publics situated in and emergent from advanced interactive computer-communication technologies.

I suggest that women's increased presence in numbers does not ensure equal participation, in that they can remain confined within systems which perpetuate traditional power structures allowing very little space for manoeuvre. By remaining connected to their own embodied interests, grassroots women are uncovering how power is operating at an EU level, and in doing so are creating spaces within social networks to further emancipatory action. The article suggests that we need to learn from identity politics rather than remaining locked into identity politics, but that this learning is impeded by the relative absence of black people and those with experience of poverty in EU arenas.

In this research, patients with Ist-episode schizophrenia or affective psychosis were asked to describe supportive social relationships immediately prior to their Ist lifetime treatment contact and were interviewed 18 months and 5 years later for assessment of their social and occupational functioning. The results indicated that 18-month adaptive functioning was lower than in the year prior to Ist treatment contact but at 5 years rose above that seen both at baseline and 18 months. Moreover, social support from nonfamily members of the social network predicted 5-year adaptive functioning in the schizophrenia (n = 54) group but not in the affective psychosis (n = 55) group. Support from family did not predict 5-year outcome in either group. Together, these findings replicate and extend earlier findings that social support predicts outcome in Ist-episode schizophrenia.

Reformed Calvinists had the lowest depressive scores (CES-D); Protestants from liberal denominations the highest; Roman Catholics, Dutch Reformed, and nonchurch members were in between. Two types of explanatory mechanisms are examined: (a) social integration and (b) positive self-perceptions, which both help to prevent depression. Alternatively strict Calvinist doctrines are hypothesized to enforce negative self-perceptions, facilitating depression. For 2,509 respondents, complete data were available on social integration and serf-perceptions, as well as on the parental religious denomination. Explanatory effects were tested using hierarchic regression models. The negative association between Calvinist background and depressive symptoms was partly explained by size of social network, and between Roman Catholic background and depressive symptoms by self-esteem. Leaving church had a positive association with depressive symptoms. This depressogenic effect remained after controlling for explanatory variables.

Previous evaluations of life satisfaction and health have not completely explained the impact of social network, social support, and economics on the oral health-related behavior of elderly patients, particularly in relation to missing teeth. Purpose. This study measured the strength of associations between social network/support/class and the use of complete and removable partial dentures in elderly patients living independently. Material and methods. A multiple stepwise logistic regression was used to contrast data from previous studies relating to the subject and to explore the influence of these social variables. Results. The results substantiated the links observed in a previous study between some social features and oral fitness. More frequent use of complete dentures was identified among participants who reported higher incomes and among those who thought their incomes were sufficient for their needs. Unreplaced missing anterior teeth were associated more commonly with subjects less willing or able to leave their homes. Conclusions. Some salient features of prosthodontic care and oral health status were common to 2, comparable social environments. A minority within the elderly population may not see a need to make use of clinical dental services, regardless of how accessible these services are to them. Social network and social support issues may be important determinants in this perceived need to use clinical services.

However, the empirical evidence for the effect of co-location on communication frequency is problematic for two reasons: (I)the evidence often features either little contextual realism or doubtful internal validity, and (2) the analysis does not deal with the statistical problems typical of network data. Our study avoids the first problem by using sequential network data collected from a quasi-experiment at an industrial company that regrouped its R&D teams into a new facility. We avoid the second problem by using Wasserman and Iacobucci's (1988) method for the statistical analysis of sequential network data. Our results show that communication among R&D teams was enhanced after co-locating these teams. Surprisingly, communication frequency between R&D and marketing was not affected by the increased physical distance. This may suggest that business procedures accompanying the relocation prevented a widening gap between R&D and marketing. Alternatively, it may indicate that the effect of co-location depends on the content and medium of the communication flows.

HIV is seen in twice as many females as males, more frequently in rural than urban regions, and regions with high rates of polygamy have significantly lower rates. The evidence presented in this paper shows that HIV diffusion patterns probably reflect the spatial distribution and social networks of vulnerable social groups. While information-based campaigns are still necessary in the fight against HIV/AIDS, they fail to enable or empower vulnerable people to protect themselves against infection.

This study examines the effects of distress and three types of social relationships (family, friends, and confidantes) on the use of out-patient health services in an adult sample from a community survey of 3481 persons in Baltimore, Maryland. Methods. Independent effects of predisposing (age, education, marital status, race and sex), enabling (employment, income and insurance) and need (physical health) factors are adjusted for in estimating the odds of using health care services. Results. Illness, being female, and having insurance were positively related to use of services, while being aged was inversely related. After adjustment for the above factors, social support interacted with psychological distress to effect the use of medical care: the combination of high distress and low social support by a confidante results in a fourfold increase of medical utilization. Conclusions. Our findings support the inclusion of psychological distress and social network variables in addition to physical health status in models attempting to explain the use of health services. Despite an inability to analyse change over time, our data suggest an understanding of the interrelationship between psychosocial factors, distress and health care use would benefit health providers and their patients.

The results are consistent with the analyses of bibliographies where the co-authorship networks in invisible colleges probably have shown the same behavioural patterns as the non-scientific populations. The patterns of behaviour are portrayed in two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional representations of co-authorship data in theoretical population genetics.

Fieldwork took place in two contrasting settings: (a) Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, a socially marginalized urban community and (b) the homosexual community of Mexico City, a sexually marginalized social network. 113 in-depth interviews were conducted with people with HIV/AIDS, their relatives and members of their social networks. This paper describes findings from interviews conducted with family members of persons with AIDS. Four stages of response are identified and characterized within each community: (1) life before AIDS, (ii) life during the discovery of AIDS, (iii) living with a person with AIDS and (iv) surviving those who have died from AIDS. The social marginalization of both communities is central in explaining how families respond to the disease. In Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, social support derives from a local culture of kinship. In the gay community, on the other hand, solidarity arises out of friendship. Between social support and discrimination, many more "ambivalent" behaviours (neither fully supportive nor discriminating) are displayed by family members and friends. Fear, pre-existing family conflicts and prejudice nurture these negative responses. Family responses and the processes to which they give rise, also differ depending on whether or not a male or female household member is affected. Policy recommendations are made concerning how best to promote positive family and household responses to persons with HIV/AIDS and how to inhibit negative ones. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether quality of life predicted strokes and acute coronary events in a prospective study. Methods-The study included 412 treated hypertensive men, aged 50 to 72 years, with II of the following: serum cholesterol greater than or equal to 6.5 mmol/L, smoking, or diabetes mellitus. The Minor Symptoms Evaluation Profile (MSEP) was used to estimate quality of life at entry. Incidences of stroke and acute coronary events were recorded during follow-up. The median follow-up time was 6.6 years. Results-Sixty-four patients had an acute coronary event, and 37 had a stroke during the follow-up period. The Cox regression analyses revealed that the 3 dimensions of MSEP at entry were significant predictors of stroke. The relationship between low contentment at entry and the incidence of stroke during follow-up remained significant (relative risk = 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01 to 1.06; P=0.003) even after adjustment for other potential cardiovascular risk factors. Vitality also remained an independent predictor for stroke after adjustment for these potential cardiovascular risk factors (relative risk=1.04; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.06; P<0.0001). There was no relationship between MSEP score at entry and myocardial infarction during follow-up. Conclusions-An independent and significant association between reduced well-being at entry and future stroke was observed in hypertensive men at high cardiovascular risk. The causal relationship is not known, however.

Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion - characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization - such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity - that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the All-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologic analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Unlike the classical distance for the vertices of connected graphs, these proximity measures are applicable to weighted structures and take into account not only the shortest, but also all other connections, which is desirable in many applications. To apply these proximity measures to unweighted structures, every edge should be assigned the same weight, which determines the proportion of taking account of two routes, from which one is one edge longer than the other. A topological interpretation is obtained for the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of the Laplacian matrix of a weighted multigraph.

To examine the relationship of fatigue in people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with self-efficacy, positive and problematic aspects of social support, and demographic and disease-related variables. Method. Out-patients with at least 5 yr RA were studied. Fatigue was measured with a visual analogue scale. Other variables included were: positive social support [Social Support List - Interactions (SSL12-I)] and problematic social support; self-efficacy towards coping with RA and towards mobilizing support; health status (Dutch-AIMS2); and laboratory tests: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), haemoglobin (Hb) and rheumatoid factor (RF); and disease duration. Results. A total of 229 out-patients were included. Fatigue correlated with all scales of the Dutch-AIMS2: with pain, physical function and affect (P < 0.001). There was no significant correlation with social support, but there was a highly significant correlation of fatigue with problematic social support (P < 0.001). Both forms of self-efficacy correlated strongly with Fatigue: patients with high self-efficacy expectations towards coping with RA, and towards mobilizing the social network (P < 0.001), had less fatigue. In the regression analysis to explain the variation in fatigue, only pain, self-efficacy expectations towards coping with RA, and towards asking for help and problematic social support remained significant. Conclusions. Fatigue can to a large extent (37%) be explained by pain, self-efficacy towards coping with RA, and towards asking for help and problematic social support. It is known that self-efficacy can be enhanced by self-management courses and it may thus be possible to improve fatigue.

The study was done in Campinas, Sao Paulo State, Brazil. A total of 635 women were selected by age and socioeconomic status, using the "social network" technique. Almost half were adolescents (15-19 years old) and the rest were adults (20-45 years old). Half were of low socioeconomic status and the rest of medium-high status. The data were analyzed with SPSS PC(R) and EPI-INFO(R) 6.0. Logistic regression and chi(2) were used for the analysis. Despite some differences found between age and socioeconomic status in regard to the characteristics desired for the idealized method, most of the participants expressed the same preferences. The results indicate that women would like the idealized method to be a cream, rather than a suppository, with no odor or flavor, to be colorless, to be placed in the vagina with an applicator well before coitus, and to offer protection against sexually transmitted diseases including AIDS.

It is a core public health intervention for limiting the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV infection, in the community. This article reviews the techniques and tools currently used for STD partner notification and examines some of the special considerations for HIV infection. Concerns about the effectiveness of the strategy have underscored the need to develop and evaluate new methods of identifying at-risk partners. The use of enhancement techniques and social networks are promising areas for future inquiry.

By highlighting the multiplicities and ambiguities of social value and cultural identities implicit in the workings of commodity chains and globalization processes, the study leads to a questioning of commodity-chain analysis. It also challenges theories of cultural production and circulation based on a unified and hierarchical system of value.

However less attention has been paid to the interface of the family and peer subsystems or to the role of nonparental family members, particularly during the pre-adolescent period referred to as middle childhood. The aims of this study were (a)to examine the linkage between social support provided to the child in the context of the family and the quality of children's friendships outside the family and (b) to determine whether family support and friendship quality contribute uniquely to the child's self-esteem. Personal interviews were conducted with 185 fifth-grade African American, European American, and Hispanic American children to obtain measures of family support, friendship quality, and self-esteem. Across ethnic groups, family support was predictive of friendship quality and both family support and friendship quality were associated with self-esteem. Parents, nonparental adult family members, and siblings contributed differentially to different components of friendship quality, affirming the value of a social network perspective for the study of developmental issues.

Spouses in dual-secure marriages reported more love for their partner; less ambivalence about their relationships, were more integrated into their social networks, and felt more competent as parents than couples in dual-insecure marriages. Differences in relationship dynamics were found in secure husband-avoidant wife and secure wife-avoidant husband marriages. There was no relation between adult attachment styles, parenting behavior and the security of infant-parent attachments. Future work would benefit by focusing on the dyadic constellations of adult attachment styles and their implications for family relationships.

Findings indicated that grandmothers assessed the mother-daughter relationship as more favorable than young mothers. African American teenage mothers were more likely than White mothers to report childrearing conflicts with grandmothers. Grandmothers, regardless of race, were more likely than teenage mothers to report less conflict around raising the young mothers' babies. Although racial differences were found in the number of depressive symptoms expressed among grandmothers, this finding did not hold when controlling for socioeconomic status Similarly, the inverse relationship found between supportive maternal relations and depressive symptoms at the bivariate level of analysis was no longer important for predicting depressive symptoms among teenage mothers in the presence of conflictual mother-daughter relationships. Implications of these and other findings for future social network research and family interventions are discussed.

This paper discusses five serious kinds of constraints that people in the United States must overcome to meet their citizenship responsibilities. The constraints are: work (e.g. long hours, disruptive schedules, transfers); consumerism (e.g. time spent watching television, shopping, and engaging in entertainment activities); lack of social capital (e.g. social networks not 'tight' enough to foster people working together to address community issues); personal fears and anxieties (e.g. fear of reprisals from neighbors); and the built environment (e.g. lack of meeting places, car- rather than people-oriented land uses). The charge to futurists is to image and work toward implementing futures that overcome these constraints. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The authors conducted 16 focus groups with 141 participants, who were either at risk or experienced food insufficiency, to learn about coping strategies. Individual and network-level coping mechanisms were used to manage insufficient food supply. Social networks included family, friends, and neighbors. The assistance provided included food aid, information, and emotional support. Not all networks were relied on or accessed by everyone. Most participants reported that they relied on family members first, followed by friends, and then neighbors. Parents found reliance on anyone as stressful and often threatening. In conclusion, as the social welfare system becomes constrained, more and more households may experience food insufficiency. Responsive policies are therefore needed to assist low-income families.

To clarify factors which account for these differences, lifestyle, social network, job satisfaction and perceived health were measured in 1,165 men 40-59 years old residing in a rural village in Gunma, Japan. Comparisons were made of four occupational groups: agricultural and forestry workers, the self-employed, blue-collar workers, and white-collar workers. Agricultural and forestry workers had less obesity, good social networks with relatives and local community, lower job satisfaction, and less subjective physical symptoms and psychological complaints. The self-employed had higher job satisfaction but felt their jobs were hard. Blue-collar workers had lower job satisfaction, felt that their job was hard, and had the most subjective physical symptoms and psychological complaints. White-collar workers were the most obese, ate more Western-style foods, had more physical exercise, higher job satisfaction, did not feel the job was hard, had stronger marriage ties, and had fewer subjective physical symptoms and psychological complaints. These differences may account for differences in morbidity and mortality by occupation, and will provide useful information for health care planning in the respective occupational group. For example, improved health care will be needed for blue-collar workers who had the poorest perceived health in the community.

Seven dimensions of support were assessed over time. Of special interest to the investigators were the types and frequency of posttreatment contacts among bereaved parents who participated in an experimental support program. The study compared those who reported high versus low social support and high versus low numbers of network confidants on selected outcome and coping variables. The authors recruited a community-based sample of 171 bereaved mothers and 90 bereaved fathers whose 12- to 28-year-old children had died by accident, suicide, or homicide 4 months previously. Parents were randomly assigned to a 12-week bereavement program or control group. It was expected that intervention group parents would report more social network in involvement and greater satisfaction with support received than control group parents, This hypothesis was only partially supported. Only 20% of the parents who participated in the bereavement program remained in contact after the experimental program ended. Finally, significant differences detected between parents who reported high and low support were minimal and not sustained over time. The number of network confidants did not significantly affect the outcomes examined. However, in general, those with more confidants reported lower symptoms. Additional studies are needed to address these complex issues.

JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS			English	Article						shyness; social surrogate	SHYNESS; SOCIABILITY	The Social Surrogate hypothesis argues that high-shy persons utilize persons in their social network to engage in or facilitate anxiety-provoking social interactions. High-shy persons should report efforts to recruit persons to accompany them into social situations (Recruiting behaviors), report the Surrogate as engaging in the majority of the interactions (Utilization behaviors), and report a reduction of their anxiety and an increase in their participation in social situations (Performance Increase). In Study 1, questions were generated to assess these behaviors and were given to two samples along with measures of shyness, sociability and self-esteem. In Study 2, participants were given descriptions of 14 situations and 10 behaviors and reported their likelihood of engaging in Recruitment and Utilization behaviors. The two studies indicate that high-shy persons actively cope with their anxiety by recruiting persons in their social network, that this helps the persons to enter situations they would otherwise avoid, and that the Surrogate sometimes engages in social interactions in the place of the high-shy person.

This study sought to examine incidence rates and the social and economic antecedents of homelessness of impoverished inner-city injection drug users. Of the 569 participants, from a nontreatment sample who participated HIV prevention study, interviewed at baseline, 324 (57%) were reinterviewed 5.2 months later At baseline 48% of the participants reported that they had been homeless in the past 10 years. Of the 324, 18% reported that at both interviews they had been homeless within the prior 6 months, 12% reported homelessness at baseline but not at follow-lip, and 8% reported homelessness at follow-up but not at baseline. At baseline personal social support network characteristic of size of material aid and size of sex network was found to be associated with self-reports of homelessness. Baseline reports of presence of mother in personal network sire of material aid network, and network density were found to be associated with reports of homelessness at follow-up. These result suggest the need for alternative approaches to addressing issues of homelessness injection drug users.

The use of electronic mail, unscheduled face-to-face encounters, and scheduled face-to-face meetings predominated for the exchange of six kinds of information: Receiving Work, Giving Work, Collaborative Writing, Computer Programming, Sociability, and Major Emotional Support. Few pairs used synchronous desktop videoconferencing or the telephone, E-mail was used in similar ways as face-to-face communication. The more frequent the contact, the more "multiplex" the tie: A larger number of media was used to exchange a greater variety of information. The closeness of work ties and of friendship ties were each independently associated with more interaction: A greater frequency of communication, the exchange of more kinds of information, and the use of more media.

Analysts typically assume that such evaluations comprise a uni-dimensional ranking from low to high influence, but the extent of inter-rater consensus about judgments might vary across informants. I conceptualize the reputation measurement process as network relationships where organizational informants choose among a set of organizations treated as objects. I test three hypotheses that informant consensus increases with similarity in type of organizations, position in the influence hierarchy, and communication proximity, using data on 117 US and 126 German organizations in those nations' labor policy domains of the 1980s. Although I find some support for two hypotheses, a substantial consensus occurred between two primary blocks of informants about the most and least influential labor policy organizations. I conclude with some suggestions for further investigations of sources of consensus and variation in the evaluation of organizational reputations.

Thus, it has been very useful in analyzing structural properties within social networks. This paper presents a set of simple matrix formulas for calculating T. Previous work with the triad census has required enumerating each triad in the graph, which can be time consuming for very large networks. The formulas presented in this paper increase the efficiency of calculating T by an order of magnitude. Thus, these formulas provide researchers with very large networks, or the need to calculate T many times, an efficient tool for studying underlying structural patterns. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper addresses the research question of what predicts cognitive accuracy by developing a simple theory which links one's accuracy to the amount of information one exchanges with co-workers. To test the predictions of my theory, I analyze friendship and advice network data from a small entrepreneurial firm. The results of the analysis show that predictors of accuracy tend to be workers' degree centrality in the friendship or advice network and demographic and social distances between workers.

Existing research leaves us largely unable to explain the variation in accuracy in social network perception. This paper argues that the study of accuracy in social network perception should consider the effect of both situational factors and individual differences. To explore this claim, three research centers in an Italian university were studied. Perceptions of the friendship and the work-related advice networks in the organization were compared to the actual network. The results indicate that both an observer's position in the formal and informal social structure of the organization, and his or her personality traits contribute to determining accuracy in social network perception.

Findings from the most recent nationally representative sample, conducted in March 1996, show that when controlling for selected respondent and household characteristics, informal social networks significantly decrease the likelihood of a household evaluating its food, economic and housing condition as vulnerable.

This article aims at giving an overview of some of the methodological problems and possible solutions tied to social network analysis. Besides the better known descriptive analytical strategies of data reduction we also discuss more recent approaches that allow statistical testing and make it possible to analyse relational and attributive data at the same time. Finally, some practical concerns are touched on such as, for instance, further readings and available software.

Empirical data on sexual partnerships and sexual partner networks collected through sampling individuals are a non-random sample of partnerships and network structures even if individuals are sampled randomly. This has the potential to bias estimates of measures describing the sexual partner network. In addition, biases may be introduced through non-response and missing data. Using Monte Carlo simulation, we investigate the biases that are introduced in estimated measures of the sexual partner network through three common sampling methods. The results indicate that substantial systematic biases are introduced. The direction and magnitude of these biases suggest that, by ignoring them, the risk for the establishment and persistence of infection in a population may be underestimated.

Drug scenes (social and spatial drug-using and drug-selling environments) have complex role structures. Ma,ly drug injectors earn money or drugs as drug or syringe sellers, hit doctors (people who help others to inject) commercial sex workers, or in other roles. This paper aims to measure "role behaviors" of drug injectors; describe which drug injectors are more likely to engage in such role behaviors; and to determine whether roles are related to elements of HIV risk. Design. Cross-sectional study of drug injectors. Setting. Bushwick, a section of Brooklyn, New York, a major location for injection drug use and drug sales. Participants. Seven hundred and sixty-seven street-recruited drug injectors. Measurements. Participants were interviewed about their roles, behaviors, socio-demographics and risk networks; sera were collected and assayed for HIV and hepatitis B core antibody. Findings. Socio-demographic variables are related to role-holding in complex ways. Economic need is generally associated with engaging in drug-scene role behaviors. Holders of these, roles are at greater behavioral and network risk for HIV and other blood-borne infections than are other drug injectors. They also engage in extensive communication with other drug users, including discussion of HIV risk reduction. Conclusion. Role behaviors can be measured in quantitative studies, and seem to be related to HIV risk. Role-holders may be strategic targets for risk-reduction campaigns.

Method: the study area was a municipality in mid-eastern Sweden with a population of about 21 000. Data from interviews with non-institutionalized people aged 75 years and older in 1986 (n = 421) were linked to an individual-based research registry of prescription drug purchases. The elderly subjects were followed for 6 years. Information on mortality was obtained from the national cause of death register. A combined measure of morbidity captured both self-reported symptoms/diseases and prescription drugs. Results: mortality was higher in men than women (P< 0.001). Multivariate analysis was performed using logistic regression analysis. Among elderly men, morbidity-related factors-self-rated global health, heart problems and diabetes mellitus, for example-were the most important predictors of mortality. Among women, the predictors were spread over more domains (morbidity, mobility, social network).

The main purpose of this study was to characterize the status of the matching hypotheses at the 3-year follow-up. This entailed investigating which matching findings were sustained or even strengthened across the 3-year study period, and whether any hypotheses that were not supported earlier eventually emerged at 3 years, or conversely, whether matching findings discerned earlier dissipated at this later time. This research also examines the prognostic effects of the client matching attributes, characterizes the overall outcomes at 37 to 39 months, and explores differential effects of the three treatments at extended follow-up. With regard to the matching effects, client anger demonstrated the most consistent interaction in the trial, with significant matching effects evident at both the 1-year and 3-year follow-ups. As predicted, clients high in anger fared better in Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) than in the other two MATCH treatments: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF). Among subjects in the highest third of the anger variable, clients treated in MET had on average 76.4% abstinent days, whereas their counterparts in the other two treatments (CBT and TSF) had on average 66% abstinent days. Conversely, clients low in anger performed better after treatment in CBT and TSF than in MET. Significant matching effects for the support for drinking variable emerged in the 3-year outcome analysis, such that clients whose social networks were more supportive of drinking derived greater benefit from TSF treatment than from MET. Among subjects in the highest third of the support for drinking variable, TSF participants were abstinent 16.1% more days than MET participants. At the lower end of this variable, difference in percent days abstinent between MET and TSF was 3%, with MET clients having more abstinent days. A significant matching effect for psychiatric severity that appeared in the first year posttreatment was not observed after 3 years. Of the 21 client attributes used in testing the matching hypotheses, 11 had prognostic value at 3 years. Among these, readiness-to-change and self-efficacy emerged as the strongest predictors of long-term drinking outcome. With regard to the overall outcomes, the reductions in drinking that were observed in the first year after treatment were sustained over the 3-year follow-up period: almost 30% of the subjects were totally abstinent in months 37 to 39, whereas those who did report drinking nevertheless remained abstinent an average of two-thirds of the time. As in the 1-year follow-up, there were few differences among the three treatments, although TSF continued to show a possible slight advantage.

This question is addressed through comparative analysis of the emergence of human rights organizations under military dictatorships in Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina. While severe state repression is expected to lead to generalized demobilization, these cases reveal that repression may directly stimulate collective action. The potential for sustained collective action in high-risk contexts depends upon the relationship between strategies of repression and the particular configuration of embedded social networks; it is more likely where dense yet diverse interpersonal networks are embedded within broader national and transnational institutional and issue networks.

A standardized questionnaire that incorporates self-report measures of well-being demographic data, and social network was used for data collection. Results of the analysis show significant gender differences in all measures of subjective well-being. The overall findings indicate that family network and interdependent support make greater contributions to the psychological well-being of the old-old in Hong Kong than their network of friends.

Individual and group interviews were conducted using questionnaires on Banks Peninsula, New Zealand (a rural, farm-based setting) with 270 residents from 1987 to 1989, with 80 out-migrants interviewed around New Zealand in 1989. The methodology was based on phenomenology, ethnography, and social surveys. Statistical analyses indicated the significance of residential status and social belonging toward the development of a sense of place. Contextual influences were found to be important from qualitative data, with traditional culture of primary importance to Maori. Both Maori and European-descent respondents with long-term residence expressed a rooted sense of place for Peninsula environs. These respondents were less residentially mobile and were often tied to the land through ancestry and/or family farms. Newcomers to the region were usually treated as outsiders (for decades). The Maori community was partially sustained by a social network that extended beyond the Peninsula. Maori sense of place was based more on their cosmology and culture, which rooted them to their tribal territory spiritually and emotionally. To counter an amoral, modernist hegemony and to move toward community sustainability, postmodernists need to consider the significance of developing a place-based ideology that links people to place through a rooted sense of place.

The purpose of this project was to report the psychometric properties of the revised Hospice Quality of Life Index (HQLI) including validity and reliability for hospice patients with cancer. DESCRIPTION: Data were collected from home care hospice patients with cancer (n=255) and a group of apparently healthy adults in the community (n=32). The revised HQLI is a 28-item self-report instrument that includes three subscales: Psychophysiological Well-being, Functional Well-being, and Social/Spiritual Well-being. RESULTS: Evidence for validity was provided in three ways. First, factor analysis confirmed the three subscales (Psychophysiological, Functional, and Social/Spiritual Well-being). Second, a weak significant correlation was found between the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status Rating scores and HQLI scores (r=.26, P=.00). Third, the HQLI was able to discriminate between hospice patients with cancer and apparently healthy adults (lambda = .34, P=.00). In addition, the mean scores of these two groups were significantly different (t=6.64: P= .00). However, only a minimal difference in scores was found on the Social/Spiritual Well-being subscale between the cancer and healthy groups. Reliability for the revised HQLI was high for both the total scale (alpha=.88) and the subscales (alpha= .82-.85). CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Emphasis has been placed recently on understanding quality of life from the patients perspective. The development of a valid and reliable tool can guide care givers in providing meaningful quality-of-life issues and to maintain direction over a critical aspect of their care. Of note from this study, the significant difference in social/spiritual well-being suggest that patients are able to appraise their functional abilities realistically and still maintain their social network and spiritual beliefs. Indeed, it may be that patients give family relationships and spiritual beliefs greater focus during a terminal illness.

Of these four, social network/context has received the least amount of study and has been described in terms not easily applicable to intervention. In this paper, we identified the social network/context of diabetes management as residing within the family. We defined the family for clinical purposes, reviewed the literature concerning what is known about the link between properties of the family context of care and outcomes in type 2 diabetes and other chronic diseases, and identified areas of family life that are relevant to diabetes management. This information was then used to demonstrate how a family context of care can serve as a clinical framework for integrating all four groups of factors that affect disease management Implications of this approach for practice and research are described.

This raises questions about the appropriate governance capacity to deliver such improvements. I argue that a key element of such capacity lies in the quality of local policy cultures. Some are well integrated, well connected, and well informed, and can mobilise readily to act to capture opportunities and enhance local conditions. Others are fragmented, lack the connections to sources of power and knowledge, and the mobilisation capacity, to organise to make a difference. In recent years, the emphasis in attempts to change urban governance capacity, particularly in Britain, has been on encouraging catalytic projects and partnerships. Recent experience across Europe suggests that wider transformative effects are difficult to achieve without careful consideration of the partnership form and how it connects to the wider policy culture. They may also have the effect of increasing the fragmentation of local capacity. I examine the potential of collaborative approaches in place-making initiatives in achieving more effective and durable transformations. Collaborative approaches emphasise the importance of building new policy discourses about the qualities of places, developing collaboration among stakeholders in policy development as well as delivery, widening stakeholder involvement beyond traditional power elites, recognising different forms of local knowledge, and building rich social networks as a resource of institutional capital through which new initiatives can be taken rapidly and legitimately. They shift the task of urban planning from 'building places' to fostering the institutional capacity in territorial political communities for ongoing 'place-making' activities.

These groups are not well understood, and there has been no quantitative analysis of their impact on minority employees. Social network theory suggests that network groups should enhance the social resources available to women and minorities and in that way enhance their chance of career success, but some critics of network groups suggest that backlash might produce greater social isolation and discrimination. In this paper, we analyze a survey of members of the National Black MBA Association to find out whether network groups have a positive impact on career optimism, what specific effects of these groups are most beneficial, and whether groups enhance isolation or discrimination. Results indicate that network groups have a positive overall impact on career optimism of Black managers, and that this occurs primarily via enhanced mentoring. Network groups have no effect on discrimination, either positive or negative. There are some indications of greater isolation, but also some indications of greater contact with Whites.

Black Catholics were found to display higher levels of the more private styles of religious devotion and report a greater frequency of spiritual experiences than white Catholics. Especially interesting are the high rates of participation by black Catholics in a variety of traditional, uniquely Catholic styles of devotion. Contrary to expectations, the correlates of religiosity for black and white Catholics tend to be similar. For both groups, social network variables are the strongest net predictors of every measure of religiosity.

Some of these behavioral adaptations include: (1) given low and dispersed Folsom populations, foragers used high mobility to locate mates and maintain kinship, economic, and social networks; (2) because the hunting of bison was the optimal subsistence choice, Folsom groups were likely characterized by a disproportionate male contribution to the diet and, thus, a male-biased juvenile sex-ratio; and (3) given the relatively uniform nature of the Folsom tool kit across the Plains, a many-to-one (slow), concerted model of cultural transmission may have operated.

Examining the human, financial, and social capital of Jamaican microentrepreneurs	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS VENTURING			English	Article							SELF-EMPLOYMENT; ENTREPRENEURSHIP; EXCHANGE; CREATION	This research examines the performance of 215 informal microenterprises in Jamaica, studying the influence of human capital, social capital, and financial capital of the owners on their business profitability. Understanding die importance of particular relationships that result in successful micro-businesses is important for a number of reasons. First, among many developing countries, the growth of microenterprise microenterprise provides the most visibly vibrant and growing economic activity. Although considerable effort and resources are being directed toward microenterprise promotion schemes, empirical research on the subject is quite limited. Second, economies in developing countries mirror many of the social and institutional problems existent in urban economically disadvantaged areas of the United States and other developed countries. For these areas, microenterprise may be an essential component of urban renewal and community development. This study helps in identifying important characteristics of social social and individual attributes that may be relevant to those attempting to strengthen this subsector. Finally, this study seeks to provide insight into a dimension of microbusiness research for which there are limited data, specifically, the role that social capital plays among practicing entrepreneurs and owners. This research found that different structural environments, even within a singular and small economy, may considerably alter the rates of return to human, social, and financial capital. As a result, the analysis of enterprises includes segmentation according to both the usage, or not, of employees, and the sophistication of the technologies used. Several factors were determined to enhance the profitability of the businesses in all categories. Vocational training, for example, demonstrated consistently strong and positive effects. Mother's high occupational status (a proxy for socioeconomic status) and years of experience in the business were also consistently positive and strongly associated with increasing profits. Although additional starting capital played an important role for both the businesses with and without employees, increasing amounts failed to differentiate the success of those firms that were already operating in the higher technological tier. Obtaining a small business loan acted in a similar manner, enhancing the profitability of all firms, except those segmented into a high technological tier. One interpretation of this finding is that the role of technological choice is extremely important, and appears to dwarf that of varying amounts of starting capital. Social capital, as operationalized by frequent church attendance and marital status of the owner, was found generally to increase the profitability of the business. The data demonstrate that social networks play an important role in the success of these businesses, and that conditions in the highest tier utilize social capital in a somewhat unique manner.

They descended from a representative sample with 600 persons out of 3 years of birth (1935, 1945, 1955) in the general population (psychotic disorders were excluded). They were within a period of 10 years either in stable mental health or in chronic illness. The comparison between this two groups concerned demographic variables, development during childhood, personality, stressfull life events, social network and clinical data. The ascertained prevalence is 12,7% (from n=600) for stable mental health and 3,5% for chronic illness. The group with the highest risk of chronic diseases is those of women and men with bad achievement and small social competence.

In both cultures, the interpersonal environment exerted significant and consistent effects on individual voting preferences. Those who reported inhabiting relatively homogeneous interpersonal political environments (IPEs) displayed a strong tendency to vote for the same political party as the important others in their social network. This effect was robust even after controlling for party identification, attitudes, media exposure, and objectively defined group memberships. Importantly, this tendency was not predicated on the frequency of talk about politics with significant others. Implications are discussed for both micro-level and macro-level theories of social structure and political behavior; an argument is made for the importance of a "middle path"-the psychology of enduring relationships between people.

The production of social capital in personal networks was examined with the use of social network and participation data from the 1992 American study of the Cross National Election project. The results suggest that politically relevant social capital (that is, social capital that facilitates political engagement) is generated in personal networks, that ir is a by-product of the social interactions with a citizen's discussants, and that increasing levels of politically relevant social capital enhance the likelihood that a citizen will be engaged in politics. Further, the production of politically relevant social capital is a function of the political expertise within an individual's network of relations, the frequency of political interaction within the network, and the size or extensiveness of the network. These results are sustained even while taking account of a person's individual characteristics and organizational involvement. Hence, the consequences of social relations within networks are not readily explained away on the basis of either human capital effects ol the effects of organizational engagement.

Influences of the social environment are important in determining eating behavior. Family influences have been demonstrated by resemblances in intakes within families, but research on resemblance in intake between friends is lacking. We investigated the resemblance in fat and food intake within social networks that included family members and peers. Methods. Fat consumption was assessed with a food frequency questionnaire in 361 social networks consisting of 15-year-old adolescents (n = 347), their mothers (n = 309), their fathers (n = 270), their friends (n = 240), 79 friends of mothers, and 29 friends of fathers. Ten family interviews and four focus group interviews were carried out in a subsample. Results. Within the nuclear family, the intake of 76 to 94% of the foods was significantly associated, which resulted in moderate Pearson correlations for fat and fatty acid intake (% of energy intake) between parents (0.30-0.34), between mother and child (0.19-0.38), and between father and child (0.16-0.26). No significant correlations for fat intake were found between friends, but the consumption of specific foods was related. Conclusions. We found clear resemblance in habitual fat and food intake between parents and their adolescent children and between spouses. Friends do not seem to have a lot of influence on the fat intake of adolescents and adults in this population. (C) 1998 American Health Foundation and Academic Press.

Methods: Cross-sectional analyses of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological factors and educational attainment were conducted using data from a population-based cohort study of older men and women. Participants consisted of 70- to 79-year-old residents of communities of East Boston, MA: New Haven, CT; and Durham County, NC (N = 1192) participating in the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly programs, a three-site longitudinal study of community-dwelling men and women. Participants were selected on the basis of high physical and cognitive function, representing approximately the top third of their peers in terms of functional ability in 1988. In-home interviews were conducted. Associations among education and behavioral (e.g., cigarette smoking and physical activity), biological (e.g., pulmonary function, serum cholesterol), psychological (e.g., self-efficacy, anxiety), and social (e.g., networks and support) factors were examined. Results: Low levels of education were associated with poorer psychological function (less mastery, efficacy, happiness), less optimal health behaviors (increased tobacco consumption and decreased levels of physical activity), poorer biological conditions (decreased pulmonary function, increased body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio), and larger social networks (increased number of contacts, decreased negative support). Several factors (alcohol consumption, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were nonlinearly related to educational attainment. Conclusions: Educational attainment is associated with a broad array of psychosocial and biological conditions among the elderly. That an education gradient functions over an array of factors that structure daily life, even in later life in a healthy population, may suggest how socioeconomic status influences health.

After wide excision of the primary tumour, patients without metastases are subjected to follow-up examinations, No further standard medical treatment is currently available for such patients. This results in psychosocial stress, and psychological adjustment and social support are needed - especially in patients with poor prognosis and visible scars. This article reviews recent evidence of the psychosocial correlates in melanoma disease in the context of past research, Factors discussed include psychosocial distress, coping with cancer, support from the social network, and the need for professional psychosocial intervention and its effectiveness. Previous studies which have investigated the correlation between psychosocial factors and the course of the disease are also reviewed. Additionally, suggestions for future research are discussed.

SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article							SCIENCE; INDICATORS; SCIENTOMETRICS; MODEL	Citations support the communication of specialist knowledge by allowing authors and readers to make specific selections in several contexts at the same time. In the interactions between the social network of(first-order) authors and the network of their reflexive (that is, second-order) communications, a sub-textual code of communication with a distributed character has emerged. The recursive operation of this dual-layered network induces the perception of a cognitive dimension in scientific communication. Citation analysis reflects on citation practices. Reference lists are aggregated in scientometric analysis using one (or sometimes two) of the available contexts to reduce the complexity: geometrical representations ('mappings') of dynamic operations are reflected in corresponding theories of citation. For example, a sociological interpretation of citations can be distinguished from an information-theoretical one. The specific contexts represented in the modern citation can be deconstructed from the perspective of the cultural evolution of scientific communication.

Comments on theories of citation?	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Article								It is argued that Leydesdorff's theory of citations mixes the ideal or pure case with complicating factors. Ideally, citations are used as shorthand and for ethical reasons. The social network between scientists should be seen as a second-order correction on the basic model or, sometimes, even as noise. Metaphorically speaking Leydesdorff's theory is not a theory about ideal gases, but about polluted air.

In all centres, relatives experienced higher levels of burden when they had poor coping resources and reduced social support. Relatives ill Mediterranean centres, who reported lower levels of social support, were more resigned; and more often used spiritual help as a coping strategy. These data indicate that family burden and coping strategies call be influenced by cultural factors, and suggest that family interventions should have also a social focus, aiming to increase the family social network and to reduce stigma.

The adoption of problem-focused coping strategies was more frequent among young relatives and among relatives of younger patients, and was associated with higher levels of practical and emotional social support and of professional help. In contrast, emotion-focused strategies were more frequently adopted by relatives who had been living longer with the patient and who had poorer social support. It is suggested that supportive and educational interventions should be provided as early as possible to relatives of patients with schizophrenia, which, in addition to having a practical focus, should also have a social focus, aiming at extending the family's social network.

A much greater cohesiveness of social relationships was noted in the smaller home at both time points, whereas in the larger home residents had failed to develop friendships and intimacy within their social group. A number of hypotheses were explored to explain this difference. None of the factors investigated provided an explanation, including the mental state of the patients prior to discharge, their problems of social behaviour, the size of the group homes, whether they were staffed or unstaffed, and the patients' age. However, the development of friendships and intimacy over a 5-year period was strongly determined by the quality of the patients' social networks while in hospital. Consequently, when selecting groups of patients to share homes in the community, it is deemed advisable to form groups that fully reflect the range and diversity of their social networks.

Methods: The baseline study in 1984 included 734 70-year-old men and women in Glostrup (county of Copenhagen). The variables comprised the structure and the function of the social network, education, income and functional ability. Eleven years later, in November 1995, information about deaths was obtained From the Central National Register. Results: The study showed an independent association between social relations and mortality. Men who did not help others with repairs and who lived alone and women with no social support to other tasks had increased risk of dying during the follow-up period. Conclusions: This study supports (1) that there is an association between social relations and mortality, (2) that two aspects of the function of social relations matters: (a) to receive support;for small or larger tasks needed, (b) to help others with different tasks, and (3) that social relations may serve different functions for men and women.

This relationship is likely mediated by the ion term sequelae of sexual abuse. One plausible causal pathway posits that specific social network characteristics increase HIV risk exposure opportunities. This is premised on the belief that previous sexual abuse predisposes some women to become members of risk networks characterized by deviant behaviors and that HIV risk occurs in the context of these networks. One hundred and thirty women;opiate users were systematically recruited from methadone maintenance and syringe exchange programs in New York City. The women participated in a one hour interview and provided information on drug use and frequency, HIV drug and sex risk behaviors, social network characteristics, and sexual abuse histories. Univariate and logistic regression techniques were used to test :he relationship between sexual abuse and increased HIV risk as mediated by social network characteristics. previous sexual abuse was strongly related to all social network characteristics examined. Moreover, these network characteristics appeared to affect patterns of drug use in identifiable ways. Social isolation was the only network characteristic associated with both HIV drug and sex risk behaviors. However, although a history,of sexual abuse was significantly associated with five of the seven specific HIV risk behaviors examined, the relationship between sexual abuse and HIV risk behaviors remained unchanged when social network characteristics were included in the statistical model. Overall, the results suggest that a sexual abuse experience or its aftermath influence behavior far into the future. However, the results of this study did not show social network characteristics mediating the relationship between sexual abuse and HIV risk. Rather, previous sexual abuse and social network characteristics appear to be independent contributors to HIV risk behaviors for women. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Women reported a total of 795 network members, with an average network size of 5.9 individuals. The networks were long-term, ethnically homogeneous, and of high density. Support within personal networks is contingent on the types of support required, the relational characteristics, and the network structures. Findings from this study may be useful in helping practitioners and program developers to better comprehend the social milieu of drug users, particularly women enrolled in methadone treatment programs.

Methods: From a cohort of 595 persons at high risk (prostitutes, injecting drug users, and sexual partners of these persons) and nearly 6000 identified contacts, we examined the social networks of a subset of 96 persons who were interviewed once per year for 3 years. We assessed their network configuration, network stability, and changes in risk configuration and risk behavior using epidemiologic and social network analysis, and visualization techniques. Results: Some significant decrease in personal risk-taking was documented during the course of the study, particularly with regard to needle-sharing. The size and number of connected components (groups that are completely connected) declined. Microstructures (small subgroups of persons that interact intensely) were either not present, or declined appreciably during the period of observation. Conclusions: In this area of low prevalence, the lack of endogenous transmission of HIV may be related in part to the lack of a network structure that fosters active propagation, despite the continued presence of risky behaviors. Although the relative contribution of network structure and personal behavior cannot be ascertained from these data, the study suggests an important role for network configuration in the transmission dynamics of HIV.

Objective. - To estimate the independent contribution of reported elder abuse and neglect to all-cause mortality in an observational cohort of community-dwelling older adults. Design. - Prospective cohort study with at least 9 years of follow-up. Setting and Patients. - The New Haven Established Population for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly cohort, which included 2812 community-dwelling adults who were older than 65 years in 1982, a subset of whom were referred to protective services for the elderly. Main Outcome Measures. - All-cause mortality among (1) elderly persons for whom protective services were used for corroborated elder mistreatment (elder abuse, neglect, and/or exploitation), or (2) elderly persons for whom protective services were used for self-neglect. Results. - In the first 9 years after cohort inception, 176 cohort members were seen by elderly protective services for verified allegations; 10 (5.7%) of these were for abuse, 30 (17.0%) for neglect, 8 (4.5%) for exploitation, and 128 (72.7%) for self-neglect. At the end of a 13-year follow-up period from cohort inception, cohort members seen for elder mistreatment at any time during the follow-up had poorer survival (9%) than either those seen for self-neglect (17%) or other noninvestigated cohort members (40%) (P < .001), In a pooled logistic regression that adjusted for demographic characteristics, chronic diseases, functional status, social networks, cognitive status, and depressive symptomatology, the risk of death remained elevated for cohort members experiencing either elder mistreatment (odds ratio, 3.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-6.7) or self-neglect (odds ratio, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.5), when compared with other members of the cohort. Conclusions. - Reported and corroborated elder mistreatment and self-neglect are associated with shorter survival after adjusting for other factors associated with increased mortality in older adults.

Relative to majority group members, racial minorities and women in a master of business administration cohort were more likely to make identity and friendship choices within-group. The marginalization of racial minorities in the friendship network resulted both from exclusionary pressures and from minority individuals' own preferences for same-race friends. By contrast, the marginalization of women resulted more from exclusionary pressures than from their preferences for woman friends.

The authors evaluated the cost-effectiveness of a community-level HIV prevention intervention that used peer leaders to endorse risk reduction among gay men. Methods. A mathematical model of HIV transmission was used to translate reported changes in sexual behavior into an estimate of the number of HN infections averted. Results. The intervention cost $17150, or about $65 000 per infection averted, and was therefore cost-saving, even under very conservative modeling assumptions. Conclusions. For this intervention, the cost of HIV prevention was more than offset by savings in averted future medical care costs. Community-level interventions to prevent HIV transmission that use existing social networks can be highly cost-effective.

Data were collected as part of a baseline assessment for a work site intervention study. Women 52 years and older completed a self-administered survey. Those not in compliance with screening guidelines (n = 194) were included in the analyses. Logistic regression revealed that self-efficacy and strong supportive social influences were significantly associated with mammography intention (odds ratio [OR] = 2.50, OR = 2.22, respectively), adjusting for prior mammography use. Findings suggest that interventions designed to promote mammography should build women's confidence in their ability to discuss mammography with health providers and to obtain regular mammograms.

The project has provided outreach to 8400 youth at risk and has provided clinical services to 296 young men (16.6% HIV positive) and 352 young women (9.1% HIV positive). Situated within the Division of Adolescent Medicine at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, the project consists of a general medical clinic for youth along with psychosocial services including case management, counseling, and related ancillary services. A key part of the model is to provide health services within a general medical clinic for youth where participation in the clinic does not serve to identify a youth to his or her peers in the waiting room as having HIV. Another key part of the model is to provide extensive outreach within the community including contacts at bars and social clubs where high-risk youth congregate, on the street, and through the social networks of youth already identified as having HIV who participate in the CHLA clinics. In the last 2 years of the program, the peer outreach component has been strengthened and peer support activities have also been implemented. The program also has developed a Computer-Assisted Adolescent Referral System (CAARS), available on diskette and on the Internet, for the referral of youth to services in the Hollywood area.

A 20-item PQOL scale measured participants' satisfaction with multiple facets of their lives. Age, gender, marital status, and living alone were not associated with this outcome. Hispanic persons with higher incomes had consistently higher ratings of quality of life compared to NHWs. More education was associated with a higher PQOL rating only among NHWs. More close friends and relatives, visiting in homes, and participation in outside activities were all independently related to PQOL. Interaction tests showed that the impact of social networks was stronger in NHWs. These findings suggest that network size and contact are important social factors that can improve quality of life for both ethnic groups. However, differences may need to be examined when judging the magnitude of these associations and when planning interventions.

Using a sample of 267 boys and girls, the results showed that self-esteem mediated the relation between perceived closeness with parents at Time I and affiliation with delinquent friends at Time 2 but only for those who were rejected by the majority of their peers.

In that case people depend on their social networks. The support a person receives through a given network of social ties is examined. However, ties are diverse and subject to change. By means of a model of the dynamics of social ties, the conditions for adequate private support are analyzed. The sustainability of private support over time is examined by incorporating the impact on social ties of lending and receiving support. It is shown that support is only an effective alternative in a limited number of situations.

Method: Mothers and fathers of 6- to 20-year-old survivors of childhood cancer (n = 331 families) completed a questionnaire battery in this two-site study. The outcome variable was the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index. Multiple regressions and path analyses were used to test the model. Results: For both mothers and fathers, anxiety was the strongest predictor of posttraumatic stress symptoms. The current family and individual variables also contributed significantly, particularly with respect to the individual contributions of perceived life threat, perceived treatment intensity, and social support. Objective medical data did not contribute to posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions: Parental anxiety warrants attention throughout the course of treatment for childhood cancer and after treatment ends. Beliefs about past and present life threats associated with cancer treatment and family and social support are other important targets for intervention.

We suggest that individuals' groups of relevant others are considerably smaller than is usually assumed in the Olsonian tradition. Instead of focusing on the interest group as a whole, we argue that a group of relevant others consists of those to whom the individual is tied through various social bonds. Since these groups tend to be small, social selective incentives are likely to be efficient in inducing individual participation. In testing these ideas empirically, we use microdata on members of a Swedish temperance movement organization during the period of 1896-1937. We estimate how individuals' groups of relevant others are composed with respect to membership in the movement organization and how the composition of the groups affects individuals' decisions to join the movement organization. The results of the analysis support our thesis that additional movement members in the group of relevant others increase an individual's propensity to join a social movement organization. However, the results also lend support to Olson's free-rider thesis: When controlling for the composition of the group of relevant others, additional members in the movement as a whole decrease an individual's propensity to join the movement.

A cross-sectional study of residents in New York City was conducted linking mortality records from 1988 through 1994, to the 1990 United Stales Census data stratified by zipcode. All-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality rates for non-Hispanic blacks and whiles were estimated by zipcode. Zipcodes were aggregated according to the degree of residential segregation (predominant ly (greater than or equal to 75%) white and black areas) and mortality rates were compared. Multiple regression analysis was used to associate population characteristics with mortality. In New York City, although overall mortality rates of blacks exceed whiles, these rates varied substantially by locality according to the pattern of racial segregation. Whites living in the higher (mainly white) socioeconomic areas had lower mortality rates than whites living in predominantly black areas (1473.7 vs 1934.1 for males, and 909.9 vs 1414.7 for females for all-cause mortality). This was true for all age groups. By contrast, elderly blacks living in black areas, despite their less favorable socioeconomic status, had lower mortality rates for all-cause, total cardiovascular disease, and coronary heart disease, than did those living in white areas, even after adjusting For available socioeconomic variables. Racial segregation in residence is independently associated with mortality. Within racially segregated areas, members of the dominant group, for all age, among whites and elderly blacks, enjoy outcomes superior both to members of the minority racial group of their community, and to members of the same race residing in other areas, where they are in the minority, independent of socio-economic status.

The size and content of the social network were researched with the social network map developed by Klefbeck et al. (1988), while the psychiatric symptoms were evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS, Overall and Gorham, 1962). The study was based on self-reports of persons with mental disability (n = 29) admitted to short-term psychiatric inpatient care in a special psychiatric unit. After psychiatric short-term inpatient care there was a tendency towards a decrease in social network size. Family members belonged less often to patients' most important persons at follow-up than on admission (p<0.027). There was no correlation between the changes in the size of patients' social networks and psychiatric symptoms. The Klefbeck et al.'s network map was found to be an illustrative research tool for studying the networks of persons with mental disability. The psychiatric symptoms of all our patients could be evaluated with the BPRS. Patients' experiences of the interruption of relationships after shortterm inpatient care were not found to be disadvantageous to them. Further controlled social network studies on dually diagnosed outpatients and inpatients are needed.

Simultaneously, resettlement featured prominently in the agenda for poverty alleviation programmes in many of these countries, particularly in Bangladesh. Draconian measures are also taken to remove the migrant poor from the centre of the city, both by the government and the vested interest groups with a view to taking control of the land. Such measures could neither resettle the poorer people, nor reduce urban poverty. Rather, it has more negative implications for poorer women than men, as it threatens their security and job opportunities, more than anything else. The paper argues that to be meaningful, poverty reduction programmes in urban areas must address the issues of women's security, identity and the protective umbrella of social networks, work opportunities and must involve poorer communities as partners while implementing housing and shelter programmes.

Anxiety disorders have been reported to decrease with age, while anxiety feelings have been reported to be as common as in younger age groups. In order to further explore this relationship and variables associated with anxiety, a population of very elderly persons was examined, Methods. 966 persons, aged 78 years and over, underwent an examination by a physician including a structured psychiatric interview. Results. Anxiety feelings an strongly associated with psychiatric disturbances (anxiety disorders and depressive disorders). Moreover, the feelings were associated with dementia, a history of psychiatric disorders (most often depression), being female and being dissatisfied with social network. Few of those with a psychiatric disorder were adequately treated, in spite of the fact that most of them had seen a physician during the past month. Conclusions. After excluding an anxiety disorder, one of the most important things to consider in a very old person with anxiety is whether depression is present or not. Generally, there is a need for more education of physicians concerning the common mental disorders in the elderly in order to improve their management. (C) 1998 John Wiley gr Sons, Ltd.

A sample of ill Japanese American elderly (mean age: 74 years) who resided in the New York City metropolitan area were interviewed using a structured survey questionnaire. The study revealed several significant interaction effects between norms and social support. Japanese American elderly who had strong noons toward reciprocating support did not receive the full benefit of social support because of the negative impact of norms of reciprocity. Elderly who had received material support from family and had strong norms toward reciprocity were more depressed, showed more symptoms of aging and were less satisfied with their lives than those elderly who did not have strong norms of reciprocity. These findings suggest that cultural norms toward mobilizing certain types and sources of social support, and norms toward reciprocity of social support must be considered when investigating social support. Interventions to increase social support may have a negative effect on psychological well-being when recipients have strong norms toward reciprocating the support, but lack resources to do so. Future research is needed to identify effective strategies to change norms to maximize the effect of social support, particularly among elderly whose financial resources and social networks are limited.

This study assesses longitudinally the family support of a large sample of homeless mentally ill individuals participating in a supported housing program. The program randomly assigned participants to one of four experimental conditions created by varying the level of access to independent housing and the intensify of case management services provided. Substantial improvements were found during the 3-year follow-up period for frequency of family interaction, perceived availability, and satisfaction with family. Regression analyses were used to model factors correlated with change. improvement in support was not associated with housing or case management conditions. Increased levels of family support were associated with housing status and mental health status. Clients in stable independent and community housing showed greater improvement than a group of clients living an art unstable housing environment. Substantial gains in family relations also occurred among a subgroup who did not achieve housing stability, but received family housing assistance during follow-up. The lack of relationship between the experimental intervention and change in support is discussed. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Proper management of this disease is critical because of the increased morbidity and mortality associated with poor diabetes management. The role of social support in promoting diabetes management and improved glycemic control among African Americans is a little-explored area. This review, the second in a two-part series, examines the relationship between social support and glycemic control among African-American adults with diabetes. The main findings of the study are that African Americans tend to rely more heavily than whites on their informal social networks to meet their disease management needs and that social support is significantly associated with improved diabetes management among members of this population. However, there remains a critical need to systematically include substantial numbers of African-American respondents in studies examining the relationship between social support and glycemic control. Only then can the effects of age, gender, socioeconomic status, and other variables on this relationship in African Americans become clear and interventions incorporating relevant aspects of social support be developed.

The medical risk factors associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients are well known, but the psychosocial factors that may affect outcome have not been clearly defined. Psychosocial factors could affect mortality through interaction with patients' nutrition or their compliance with the dialysis prescription. We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study of urban HD patients to determine the contribution of compliance and psychosocial factors to patient survival. Methods. Patients were assessed using indices of social support, patient's assessments of their well-being, including illness effects (IEQ), and satisfaction with life (SWLS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), serum albumin concentration, Kt/V and protein catabolic rate (PCR). Behavioral compliance was measured three ways: percent time actually dialyzed per treatment compared to prescribed time (shortening behavior); percent sessions attended (skipping behavior) and total integrated time compliance (% TCOMP). A severity index, previously demonstrated to be a mortality marker, was used to grade medical comorbidity. The type of dialyzer the patient was treated with was noted. A Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for age, medical comorbidity, albumin concentration and dialyzer type was used to assess relative mortality risk of variations in psychoscial factors and behavioral compliance. Results. A total of 295 patients (60.8% of those eligible) agreed to participate. The mean (+/- SD) age of our population was 54.6 +/- 14.1 year, mean PCR was 1.06 +/- 0.27 g/kg/day, and mean Kt/V 1.2 +/- 0.4, suggesting the patients were well nourished and adequately dialyzed. The patients' mean BDI was 11.4 +/- 8.1 tin the range of mild depression). Patients' SWLS was similar to that of a group of patients without chronic illness. After a 26 month mean follow-up period, higher levels of perceived social support, improved perception of the effects of illness and increased behavioral compliance were significantly associated with decreased relative mortality risk (0.8, 0.77, and 0.79, respectively), controlled for variations in patients' age, severity of illness, serum albumin concentration and dialyzer type. Variations in depression and Kt/V were not predictors of mortality during the observation period. Conclusions. Lower levels of social support, decreased behavioral compliance with the dialysis prescription, and increased negative perception of the effects of illness are independently associated with increased mortality in ESRD patients treated with HD. The effects are of the same order of magnitude as medical risk factors. Such effects may be attributable to a relationship between a patients' perception of social support and effects of illness and behavior, with other factors such as the provision of better medical care in patients with larger social networks. The mechanism underlying the relationship of psychosocial factors and compliance and survival, and the effect of interventions to improve perception of illness, and increase social support and compliance with the dialysis prescription in HD patients should be studied.

This study examines the effects of health, predisposing, and enabling factors on recognition of a mental health problem, use of formal mental health care, and contact with a specialized mental health provider. METHODS. Interviews were conducted with a probability sample of 3,435 adults. The variables examined include measures of mental health; social and demographic factors; and enabling factors relevant to the help-seeking process. RESULTS. Subjective and objective measures of mental health were associated with the recognition of a mental health problem. The objective assessment of definite need for services was relevant for the use of formal services. However, the subjects' perception of poor mental health was strongly related to receiving care from a mental health specialist. Although interaction with social networks is associated with use of formal services, low economic strain is related to receiving care from the specialty sector. CONCLUSIONS. The results support the importance of using multiple measures of mental health problems. The finding that individuals' perceived economic strain increases the likelihood of receiving specialized care suggests that studies of economic barriers to the use of mental health services might benefit from the adoption of measures that assess perceived economic circumstances.

This study uses the recently developed Network-Episode Model (NEM) to examine the nature and correlates of utilization among Puerto Ricans reporting mental health problems. The NEM highlights two issues: (1) examining the patterns or combinations of lay and formal use that individuals employ and (2) reformulating how the availability and content of social networks influences patterns of care. METHODS. Using data from the 1989 Mental Health Care Utilization Among Puerto Ricans Study (probability sample of 1,777 individuals living in low-income areas of the island), the authors focus on the patterns and correlates of use for 365 Puerto Ricans reporting service use for mental health problems in the previous year. RESULTS. A combination of clustering and multinomial legit techniques indicates that there are six unique care patterns. Two patterns include the use of mental health providers and are associated with different contingencies. CONCLUSIONS. In general, patterns of use are shaped by age, education, gender, and illness severity. Larger, more supportive networks decrease the use of patterns of care that include formal health care providers, and decrease direct entry into the mental health sector. These results are in line with NEM's predictions for lower class populations and help clarify inconsistencies in previous research on social networks.

Both quantitative, time-series analyses and in-depth interviews demonstrate that employees adopted and used the video systems for both utility and normative reasons. Consistent with utility explanations, people in the most communication-intensive jobs were the most likely to use video telephony. Consistent with social influence explanations, people used a particular system more when more people in general were using it and when more people in their work group were using it. There were two conceptually distinct, but empirically entangled, types of social influence. First, use by other people changed the objective benefits and costs associated with using the systems, and thus their utility. Second, use by others changed the normative environment surrounding the new technology. Both utility and normative influences were stronger in one's primary work group. Implementers, users, and researchers should consider both utility and normative factors influencing both the success and failure of new organizational communication systems.

Few studies have examined prospectively both the direct and buffering effects of types of social support and social networks on mental health. This paper reports longitudinal associations between types of social support and psychiatric morbidity from the Whitehall II study. Methods. Social support was measured by the Close Persons Questionnaire and psychiatric morbidity by the General Health Questionnaire at baseline (1985-1988) and at first follow-up (1989) in 7697 male and female London-based civil servants aged 35-55 years at baseline. The cohort was followed up and baseline measures were used to predict psychiatric disorder measured by the General Health Questionnaire at second follow-up (1991-1993). Results. Longitudinal analyses showed that low confiding/emotional support in men and high negative aspects of dose relationships in men and women were associated with greater risk of psychiatric morbidity even after adjustment for baseline General Health Questionnaire score. There was no evidence of a buffering effect among men or women who experienced life events or chronic stressors. Controlling for a personality measure of hostility did not affect the observed relations. Conclusions. The present findings illustrate that different types of support are risk factors for psychological distress and that they operate in different ways for men and women. Direct effects of emotional support are predictive of good mental health in men and negative aspects of close relations predict poor mental health in both men and women. Emotional support is predictive of good mental health in women whereas, confiding alone is not.

The study is an elaboration of models developed in earlier papers using iterated games [Weesie, J., Buskens, V., Raub, W., 1998. The management of trust relations via institutional and structural embeddedness. Journal of Mathematical Sociology (in press); Buskens, V., 1995. Social Networks and the Effect of Reputation on Cooperation. ISCORE Paper No. 42, Utrecht University]. We distinguish individual and group network measures. Applying a combination of approximation methods to the game-theoretic solution to the model, we derive hypotheses on the effects of density, outdegree centrality, and centralization on the level of trust a truster can have in a trustee. We conclude that higher density and outdegree induce more trust. Centralization increases trust if it is 'well organized,' i.e., actors who can place more trust are central in the network. Furthermore, we discuss theoretical evidence that the relative importance of density compared to outdegree increases if the trust problem at the dyadic level is large. Finally, we show that, in many situations, a few simple network measures explain most of the effects of the network structure as a whole. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

We aimed to determine whether quality of life was related to social network size in a group of severely mentally ill subjects living in the community. In a population-based, prospective controlled study of two sector mental health teams in South London, a random sample of representative 1-year prevalent cases of non-organic psychosis was identified. Patients were interviewed at baseline, and associations between quality of life and social network size were analysed cross-sectionally. For average quality of life there was an increase up to a certain level of social network size (about 20 social contacts). For the quality of life subscore on social relations there appeared to be an optimal middle level of network size (10-12), with lower subscores for smaller and larger networks. Multivariate analysis confirmed the associations between quality of life and social network size. In analyses of network subgroups the importance of confiding contacts was underlined.

A cross-sectional survey	SOCIAL SCIENCE & MEDICINE			English	Article						Russia; self-rated health; SF36; socioeconomic factors; psychosocial factors; control	RATED HEALTH; SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE; OUTCOME MEASURE; RISING MORTALITY; JOB STRAIN; MEN; INEQUALITIES; DISEASE; AGE	Russia has the lowest life expectancy among industrialised countries, but little is known about other health outcomes and determinants of health in the Russian population. Here we report a cross-sectional study in a national sample of the Russian population of social and psychosocial determinants of two self-reported health indicators: self rated health (shown to predict mortality in prospective studies) and physical functioning (validated against more objective health measures). A multi-stage sample of the Russian population aged 18 years and more was interviewed (n = 1599, response rate 66%). The questionnaire included political attitudes, social and economic circumstances, psychosocial factors, smoking, alcohol consumption, self-rated health and physical functioning (from the SF36 instrument). Scores of perceived control over life and over one's health were calculated from 6 and 3 questions, respectively. Data were analysed in logistic regression for two dichotomised outcomes: poor self-rated health (worse than average) and low physical functioning (less than 60% of maximum). Overall, 25% of subjects rated their health as worse than average; this is substantially more than in western countries. Perceived control over life was strongly related to both outcomes; age- and sex-adjusted OR for 1 standard deviation increase in control were 0.60 (95% CI 0.52-0.69) for Door self-rated health and 0.67 (0.57-0.81) for low physical functioning. Adjustment ibr a battery of other factors reduced these estimates only slightly. Associations between control over one's health and both outcomes were also significant, but weaker and attenuated in multivariate models. Material deprivation was also strongly related to both outcomes. Education was inversely related to self-rated health, and unmarried men reported poor physical functioning substantially more often. Subjects; not approving the economic changes reported poorer health but this association was removed by adjustment for socioeconomic factors and control. Subjects who could not rely on informal social structures when in problems reported worse health; this effect largely persisted in multivariate analyses. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that poor health status in Russia is related to dysfunction of social structures, socioeconomic deprivation, and lack of perceived control. The absence of informal social networks, vital for maintaining general welfare, seems to affect adversely self-rated health. Deprivation and low perceived control may be important mediators between the broad social environment and health in populations undergoing transition and can provide a useful framework for many biological and behavioural factors. Prospective studies are needed to address the issue of temporality and reporting bias, the major problems in interpreting these findings. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

The model allows for concurrent partnerships following a very broad class of dynamic laws. Previous work, with a stochastic version of the model, computed the reproductive number, the initial growth rate, and the final size. In the present paper, the deterministic system that is the limit for large populations is constructed. The construction is unusual in requiring two different scaling factors. Next, the approximation used by Watts and May for a related model is compared with the exact solution. This approximation is most accurate at the beginning of the epidemic and when partnerships are short. Lastly, the model is generalized to allow dependencies among partnerships. This generalization permits proportional mixing with an arbitrary distribution on the number of partners. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Inc. Ail rights reserved.

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon(13,14) (popularly known as six degrees of separation(15)). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.

In particular, this study focused on cohesive actors (friends) and structurally equivalent actors (individuals occupying the same position in a network) as sources of social information. Results on the social networks of brokers, sales assistants, and operations employees (support staff) indicate distinct differences in interaction patterns, information seeking, and social comparison processes across the three job categories. Overall, the results suggest that employees rely on structurally equivalent referents for job-related information and on cohesive referents for general organizational information and as social comparison referents.

The model was tested in two consecutive studies. Study I describes initial model development (N = 120). Study 2 presents a confirmatory factor analysis with a second sample (N = 430) to replicate the factor structure developed in Study 1. Results supported a three-factor model of network orientation that differentiated between network reference groups. Analyses of concurrent and predictive validity indicated that orientation to network reference groups was differentially related to the perceived quality and frequency of support from members of respective social network groups, croup differences (gender, race) regarding network orientation to different network reference groups were consistent with studies of other social network processes. Implications for the study of the network orientation and the study of social networks more generally are discussed.

The authors' goals in this study were 1) to estimate rates of depression during the pregnancy and 8 weeks following the birth of a child in a large representative community sample of fathers in different family structures and 2) to explore the role of stressful life events, social and emotional support, the quality of the partner relationship, and socioeconomic circumstances. Method: This study describes the relations of family setting and other correlates to men's depressive symptoms during the pregnancies (18 weeks gestation, on average) and 8 weeks after the births of children for 7,018 partners of female participants in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood. Results: Men living in stepfamilies had significantly higher levels of depressive symptoms before and after the birth than did men in more traditional families. The effect of stepfamily status on depression was mediated by education, life events, social support, social network, and level of aggression in the partnership. Conclusions: There are similarities in the patterns and correlates of depression after the birth of a child for men and women. These findings point to the importance of family and partnership ecology in the adjustment of men before and after the birth of a child.

It also created an infrastructure for program delivery. Strategies included a recommended spending model, resources that addressed barriers to healthy eating, together with group activities to enhance knowledge and skills. Community volunteers, known as Food Cent$ Advisers, were trained to deliver the project by conducting budget and cooking sessions for people in their social networks. In 1992, the Food Cent$ Project was piloted in the Great Southern Health Region of Western Australia. It successfully reached its target group of low income earners who were identified as those holding Health Care Cards. Health Care Cards were held by 37% of the 150 trained advisers and 52% of the 373 people who attended the budget and cooking sessions. Evaluation results demonstrated positive changes in self-reported dietary, cooking and shopping behaviours.

Results The duration of untreated psychosis was on average very long (130 weeks), the median Value was 54 weeks.The long duration of untreated psychosis group (> 54 weeks) had greater deterioration in the premorbid phase, a weaker social network and were more withdrawn than the short duration of untreated psychosis group (< 54 weeks). The main obstacles for receiving treatment were withdrawal and poor social network. Conclusions in order to identify people earlier, a system of detection must be mobile, easily accessible and attentive to early symptoms of psychosis. It seems to be important to educate the social network related to the individual about the importance of early treatment.

We examined the applicability of three theoretical perspectives to specific relationships differing in self-perceived closeness in three group s of adults. Participants were first year (n = 37, M-Age, = 19.1 years) and fourth year (n = 42, M-Age = 22.1 years) undergraduates, and retired teachers (n, = 42, M-Age, = 66.8 years). We find considerable similarity among the three age groups on exchange norms and reciprocity expectations, despite considerable differences in sources of supportive relationships. Results indicate greatest support for exchange based upon need over either equity or social exchange perspectives, with this being especially true for very close relationships. Older adults report relationships operating to a greater extent on expectations for long-term over short-term reciprocity than young adults. Findings highlight the importance of considering, intra-individual variation in exchange norms and expectations for reciprocity.

Interviews with 301 clients of 3 clinics at a public psychiatric facility serving West Brooklyn and Staten Island provide the data from the study. Outcome measures include nine sorts of help received from informal members of the social network and from mental health professionals; desires to improve current life conditions; and expectations for future improvements in life conditions. Through hierarchical regression procedures we examine the impact of age on these outcomes, with controls for self-reported symptoms and functioning, sex, and the presence of social network members. The results indicate that younger people receive more help from both informal social networks and from mental health professionals. In addition, younger people are more likely to want improvements in their current life conditions and to be optimistic about what the future holds for them. The decline in informal and formal support, optimism, and desire to improve their current life situations among older clients may be cause for concern among mental health professionals. Mental health service providers should give greater recognition to the impact of age on mental health service needs among persons with serious mental illnesses.

The study of British, Scandinavian and European soaps, based on an 'ethnographic' approach to the social networks in the world of the soaps, shows that these countries have developed three distinctive subtypes of the genre: the community soap, the dynastic soap and the dyadic soap. For each of these subtypes, the article analyses the gender and class context for narrative events as portrayed within the soaps. While the kinship structure in both the dynastic (or patriarchal) and the community soaps constitutes a hegemonic, taken for granted framework for the programmes, the community soaps tend to be produced in the spirit of public service broadcasting and so are more likely to problematize gender issues in their conscious attempt to transmit social messages. The dyadic form appears to be taking over in the 1990s, harping on the modern and postmodern despair of too much freedom and too little trust. It operates in a destabilized environment, in which families have more or less disappeared, romantic dyads cannot be sustained, and women's quest for enduring ties takes the form of seeking primordial, biological, 'genuine', blood ties.

Through interviews with 16 men and women corporate presidents and chief executive officers (CEOs) in Southern California, ii is found that while white men promote the dominant ideology of individualism and patriarchal gender ideology as explanations of corporate mobility and success, white women emphasize alternative perspectives by confirming the importance of social networks and peer similarities for succeeding in elite positions. These women strategically attempt to increase their cultural capital to negotiate male-dominated networks and maintain their high-status positions through such measures as obtaining advanced educational degrees or modifying speech and behavior.

Population movements take many forms, including permanent migration, temporary labour migration, mobility of highly skilled personnel, refugee movements and family reunion. Destinations include North America, the Gulf oil states and - increasingly - the fast-growing 'tiger economies' of Asia. Much of the migration is undocumented and a growing proportion of the migrants are women. So far, researchers and policy-makers have concentrated on short-term economic and regulatory aspects. But migration is likely to be a major factor bringing about social and political change in the region. The social networks which develop as part of the migratory process often make official migration control policies difficult to implement. Unplanned settlement is taking place, with important consequences for both sending and receiving societies. Scholars from a number of countries in the region have therefore established an Asia Pacific Migration Research Network to study these issues, to raise public awareness and to provide advice to policymakers. The article describes the aims and development of this Network, which is part of the UNESCO Management of Social Transformations Programme.

Over the following six years, he lived for protracted periods with four aboriginal bands, he spent a period of two to three years as an itinerant trader, and he gained some degree of proficiency in six native languages. Cabeza de Vaca's account of his own activities observations of cultural detail, and statements of intent maize it possible to infer the nature of the strategy that led him, together with three companions, from central Texas to western Mexico, where they arrived in April 1536. This strategy rested primarily on hard-won knowledge of native economic patterns social networks, and trade relations.

The responses of African American (n=2,391), Asian (n=127), Caucasian (n=9,403), and Hispanic (n=1,004) adults were compared, controlling for education. Multivariate analysis of covariance and logistic analysis indicated few cultural differences. However, the three ethnic minority groups were more likely to rely on parents or children for support as compared to Caucasians; African Americans were more likely to participate in religious organizations; Asian Americans were more likely to be involved in occupational and nationality groups; and Asian Americans and Caucasians were more likely to participate in recreational groups. These findings suggest different strategies for using networks as resources and paths of intervention across cultures.

To extend their independent functioning, environmental press on older individuals should be diminished but, at the same time, their ability to solve these problems themselves (proactivity) should be enhanced. The purpose of the present study was to identify the most important factors that influence proactivity. For this reason, a theoretical exploratory model was constructed that consisted of four types of factors that influence the adaptive problem-solving of the older individual and the adaptive strategies that result from this process. These factors were: (1) problem type; (2) personal factors of competence such as health, education, and knowledge; (3) factors describing the social network; and (4) factors describing the physical environment. Adaptive strategies were categorized to be physical/technical, social, personal or mental. Subsequently, the most significant factors in this model were identified, using the data of a survey among 120 elderly households. Results of the survey show that the adaptive strategy a person chooses is not only dependent on the type of problem, but also on personal qualities and physical housing. Also, the type of adaptive strategy chosen was a predictor of the perceived effectiveness of and satisfaction with the solution. (C) 1998 Academic Press.

Respondents include both traditional family caregivers (mothers, spouses, other relatives) and non-traditional caregivers (friends, homosexual partners). Multiple regression analyses are conducted to assess the independent effects of six sets of variables on emotional and instrumental support: social-structural factors (age, education, employment status), caregiver's relationship to the person with AIDS, situational variables (caregiver's HIV status, patient's functional disability, interpersonal conflict), social network factors (contact with family, contact with friends, community integration), personal resources (mastery, caregiving competence), and use of formal community services (patient-directed services, caregiver-directed services). A number of factors and conditions appear to be relevant for caregiver support. For example, results indicate that network factors, including frequency of contact, conflict, and community integration, are importantly related to caregivers' perceptions of emotional support. There is also a trend suggesting lower emotional support among traditional family caregivers, relative to nonfamily caregivers, within gender categories With respect to instrumental assistance with caregiving, factors that place greater demands and time constraints on caregivers, such as being employed and caring for an AIDS patient with greater functional limitations, appear to increase the level of informal instrumental support the caregiver receives. Partners and spouses, however, receive significantly lower instrumental assistance, independent of other factors. Implications of the findings are discussed.

Posttraumatic growth can be accompanied by an increase in well-being, but distress and growth may also coexist. Positive changes can occur in several domains, but many are likely to be phenomenological. Degree of change produced by clinical intervention may be limited in scope, bur there clearly are some ways in which the clinician may make growth more likely for the client. Suggestions for future research include the call for longitudinal investigations, studies of rumination and responses of the social network, and the examination of potential gender differences in posttraumatic growth.

Given the dynamic, interpersonal nature of person-centered planning, the study also examined the roles that others play in the process and how facilitators, family members, and other members of the young person's social network influence the focus person's participation. Findings revealed that student participation ranged from highly active to nonexistent across the observed planning meetings. The level of student-participation was influenced by the student's conversational style, the size of the meeting, the level of abstraction in the planning discussions, and the expectations and behaviors of others.

It highlights the ways women draw on diverse economic and social resources available to them through their differing positions within gendered social networks that shape daily life and affect the ability to access and manipulate a legal system incorporating Tswana customary law and European law. The divergent discourses among women and between women and men document how the administrative and theoretical separation of legal systems does not extend to people's uses of the law in arranging their own lives. This analysis challenges the formalist model of legal pluralism by demonstrating that legal arguments are constructed from the gendered social and economic facts of individuals' lives that traverse the legal categories of European and customary law. It also contributes to feminist legal scholarship by explicitly marking the links among gender, power, and law.

The findings presented are results from a longitudinal research project, with field work in two schools for three years. Using a sociocultural approach to learning, the study focuses on the activities of two students in grade eight and nine in a Swedish secondary comprehensive school, and their interactions with peers, the teacher and artifacts of science. The data consist mainly of video and audio recordings of verbal interaction. Using a lesson on magnetic fields as a case analysis, the study reports large differences between the lessons of the two focused students in terms of opportunities for learning both about science and about their social identities. The differences found between the two girls in terms of the development of their grades and their social networks in the class seem to be closely mirrored in the classroom interaction. A comparison of the focused lessons with the rest of the data-set shows that there is a regularity in classroom experiences for the two girls studied. The results show that an understanding of "science" learning in education benefits from considering the different situations and strategies of different students. "Science" for the two girls studied seem to be a lot less, and a lot more: than what one traditionally means by the concept. The analysis can also be seen as one step toward an understanding of how the favoring of certain groups of students land the simultaneous disfavoring of others) in the Swedish comprehensive school comes about.

Ninety six HIV-infected and 33 seronegative gay men were interviewed. The HIV continuum was represented by seronegative, HIV asymptomatic and symptomatic groups. Emotional and physical support were the most frequently identified helpful supports. Symptomatic persons identified physical support as helpful more often than asymptomatic persons. Availability, acceptance and nurturing were the most frequently identified helpful emotional support behaviours, while domestic support was the most frequently identified physical support behaviour. The most frequently mentioned unhelpful support was overprotectiveness. Overall, HIV-infected people had adequate social networks. Composition of the networks of HIV-infected persons differed from that of seronegative participants, in that the former had markedly more professional and family persons and fewer friends in their network. HIV education and counselling interventions should provide emotional support, facilitate physical support for symptomatic persons, offer support that matches specific needs, include significant others, incorporate peer-help and be gay-sensitive.

The subjects numbered 839 14-year-old adolescents (408 girls and 431 boys). Aggressive behavior as well as social preference, i.e. popularity and rejection, were assessed by peer nominations. The types of aggressive behavior measured were intriguing, arguing, fighting and bullying. The results showed that not only the level, but also the types of aggressive behavior differentiated aggressive adolescents from the non-aggressive ones, and preferred adolescents from the non-preferred ones. The aggression profile of the aggressive and rejected adolescents was characterized more by intriguing and bullying than arguing or fighting. In contrast, that of non-aggressive adolescents was dominated more by arguing and fighting than intriguing. The results pointed to a more complex relationship between aggressive behavior and social preference than the general assumption that there is a higher rate of rejection among aggressive adolescents, and a higher rate of popularity among non-aggressive ones.

Findings suggest that as a person's social network extends out from family to others, Nonassertive and Aggressive persons are less likely to discuss a problem with service and their response. However, more assertive consumers are significantly more likely to discuss these same circumstances with acquaintances and others. The nature of intended verbal communications was positive for Assertive relative to Nonassertive consumers. Sex of the subject did not appear to be of importance.

The model was tested by using data from opioid-addicted persons who completed methadone treatment and were interviewed 1 year after discharge. The hypothesized model was shown to fit the data for outcomes at follow-up. A history of poor family relations was related to perceived family dysfunction and peer deviance at treatment entry; these 2 factors in turn predicted poor psychosocial functioning, which was related to higher levels of motivation. Higher motivation was associated with greater treatment engagement, which was associated with reduced opioid use and criminality. The importance of examining associations between family and peer relations and posttreatment outcomes within the context of treatment engagement is discussed.

Because of the difficulty of measuring networks, they have often been treated as a metaphor, a conceptual scheme, or a management technique (networking). The work on networks in public administration is almost all of the case study and rarely of the comparative case variety. This article presents the results of two studies of networks using social network analysis as a technique for studying structural relationships between organizations. This technique is utilized to show both the research and practical potential of network analysis as an evaluation methodology for organizations that jointly produce a service. In the first study, the network provides mental health services to seriously mentally ill adults. In the second study, the network attempts to prevent young people from abusing drugs and alcohol. The two studies were undertaken for different reasons. The first was an elaborate comparative study of four mental health networks and the relationship between network design and performance. The second was a much simpler consulting effort to help a local prevention partnership create linkages to other community organizations. However, in both of the studies the goal was to measure the structural ties in the network based on various types of relationships that exist in a given field of practice. These linkages are ties that bind the network together and become data that can be used to compare networks on their degree and type of integration. The article makes the argument that links in a network are one way that scholars can compare networks in similar or different policy domains. At the same time, the article argues that analysing linkages in an organization's network is an effective and practical means of determining how well integrated any given organization is in a network.

REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY			English	Article						single parents; basic needs; AFDC; gender	SINGLE-PARENT; FAMILIES; WELFARE	This paper applies thematic analysis to survey data obtained from a sample of AFDC recipients to investigate the complexities of single-parent decisionmaking in low-income households. A basic needs budget is developed to determine the adequacy of women's wages to provide for children's minimal material needs. Ln surveys, parents indicate their primary goal is the well-being of the children, determined by the adequacy of several types of resources, which we categorize into four groups: 1) material resources, 2) caring resources, 3) community resources, and 4) the macro-level environment. Using this framework, we develop a schematic model of single-parent decision-making, incorporating the assumption that children's level of need and well-being are determined not only by the cost and availability of material resources but also by psychological factors such as gender conflicts, neighborhood safety, as well as parents' time and social networks that provide caring labor.

The sample consisted of 119 clinically stable patients (34 females, 85 males) with symptomatic heart failure, recruited from an outpatient hospital practice. The patients underwent a brief physical examination and completed a set of questionnaires. Descriptive statistics were used to characterise the patients' informal functional network. The analysis revealed that the intimate social network support (spouses) and primary social network support (close family) were rated as most supportive. Results from the path analysis showed that social disability was explained by the two personality factors, neuroticism and extraversion, and by the severity of disease (NYHA). No significant effects of the social support variables upon social disability were detected. Moreover, path-analyses showed that poor intimate network support, social disability and neuroticism were significantly positively associated with depression.

Towards the end of 1996 the author put the same questionnaire to the same two Italo-Brussels congregations as part of tr wider survey about allochthonous religious and social networks in Brussels. The results show how the Italo-Brussels community of Jehovah's Witnesses has evolved from being a specific movement, which took advantage of first-generation immigration, into a community in which kinship-as a source of support and as a symbolic frame of reference-and a traditional family ideology a:re very much in evidence, but which henceforth will be increasingly sustained, on the one hand, by a second generation who have been born and brought up in the "Truth" and on the other hand by a network that is based on kinship and social proximity.

Institutional segmentation, settlement type and social network effects in Hungary's late state-socialist housing inequalities	SOCIAL FORCES			English	Article							INFORMAL SECTOR; TRANSITION; MARKET; CHINA; PRIVATIZATION; ECONOMIES; BUDAPEST; SHALL	This article contextualizes the "market transition debate" on the ongoing institutional transformation of former state socialist societies by examining the system of housing inequalities in Hungary three years before the regime change. It demonstrates that, by then, the differentiation of private housing ownership had already been so advanced that the private-public distinction hides important institutional variation within "private" ownership. As an alternative, we provide a four-category emic model of housing institutions for Hungary. The analysis shows that the rules of access to housing were quite differentiated by settlement type. Hence, the redistributive predominance of the socialist state weakens as we move from the urban to the rural context. Finally, we present empirical evidence that informal social network resources play a distinct role in structuring access to such significant assets as housing.

Associations between functional ability, social contacts, and emotional loneliness and social loneliness were also assessed. The sample was composed of 221 participants, age 80 to 105 years, residing in the greater Bergen area in Norway. Results demonstrated that dependence on the environment in ADL is related to low levels of emotional loneliness, whereas only dependence in activities of toileting and transferring corresponded with low levels of social loneliness. High frequency of social contacts with family friends, or neighbors was negatively related to both emotional and social loneliness. Results show that frequency of such contacts appeared to buffer the effect of continence on emotional loneliness and the effect of toileting and transferring on social loneliness.

Methods: A stochastic simulation model was used to describe a network of longterm buddy relationships in a population of IDU. HIV transmission took place when borrowing injecting equipment from an infected buddy or stranger. The probability of transmission depended on the duration of infection. Individuals remained in the population on average for 10 years. Two surveys amongst IDU in The Netherlands containing information about risk behaviour were used to estimate model parameters. We investigated the effect of different prevention strategies. Results: Below a threshold sharing frequency the epidemic never takes off; above the threshold there is a large stochastic variation in prevalence. After reduction of risk behaviour, HIV prevalence decreases very slowly. Reducing sharing with strangers is more effective than reducing the overall sharing frequency. Prevention focused on new IDU greatly reduces HIV incidence. Reduction of sharing frequency in HIV-positive IDU has no significant influence on HIV incidence at HIV testing rates of 10 and 50% per year, if infectivity is highest during primary infection. Conclusions: A stabilization of HIV prevalence does not exclude the possibility of a future rise. Predictions about the future course of an epidemic are inherently uncertain. The effect of prevention programmes on HIV prevalence only becomes visible on a long time-scale. Social networks of IDU play an important role in transmission dynamics and success of prevention.

In this paper, we report on research which has examined the impact of these changes on the lives of older people. Three urban areas: Bethnal Green and Woodford in London, and Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, are the locations for this project. All three were the subject of classic community studies in the 1940s and 1950s, providing rich material about the family and community life of older people. Using these as a baseline, we have examined changes to the social and family networks of older people over the intervening years. Our research comprised a questionnaire-based survey of 627 older people, followed-up one year later by a series of in-depth interviews with 62 people over the age of 75 (and 19 second generation members in their networks). We also undertook 35 interviews with Indian and Bangladeshi elders in Wolverhampton and Bethnal Green. Findings reported concern the living arrangements of older people and their relationships with network members. In particular, we note the marked trend towards solo living or living in married pairs amongst the white population, and the importance of multigeneration households amongst the two minority ethnic groups. Together with the enduring importance of family and the significance of friends, there are also crucial differences, notably in the ways people maintain contact with members of their networks.

Considerations on current priorities	ANNALES DE PEDIATRIE			French	Review						adolescence; risk-taking; health service accessibility; health-related behaviors; preventive medicine; social isolation	INJURY	Although most adolescents are healthy, they are prone to risk-taking behaviors, of which most are related to medicosocial or educational factors. Adolescence is a period of accelerated development characterized by extraordinarily tight interactions between the family, living conditions, life style, behaviors, physical health, and mental health. Adolescents who have lived for years in fragile, precarious, or violent environments are at a marked disadvantage. Deprivation and other problems at home become increasingly distressing as the child enters adolescence. Recent studies of youths have demonstrated marked inequalities in opportunities and exposure to risks. As compared with controls, adolescents who were cut off from the social network exhibited clear-cut differences regarding their history, their current health problems, and most notably their psychological and behavioral characteristics. "Breaking away" from society is not only the most dangerous consequence of these difficulties, but also amplifies them to a substantial extent. These situations should be identified and if at all possible, anticipated. Professionals should work together both within and outside conventional health care structures.

This approach allows for identifying who (or what) comprises each respondent's significant social network and for conducting a qualitative analysis of those positive and negative qualities that affect participant's lives. Using a self-psychology perspective, it was hypothesized that four bipolar qualities-availability, reliability, empathy, and nonintrusiveness-would emerge, with clinical individuals emphasizing the negative pole and nonclinical individuals emphasizing the positive. Both clinical and nonclinical individuals identified friends and family, with critical individuals incorporating therapists, mentors, and organized groups into their significant social influences. As expected, empathy, reliability and availability emerged, and clinical individuals had overall fewer positive themes and greater negative themes, including lack of reciprocity and feeling devalued by others. Future reseal ch must begin understanding the determinants of perceptual and relational response styles and the ways in which formal and informal support influences the life adaptation process.

They were then inoculated with common cold viruses and monitored for the onset of disease. Although seven acute stressful life events (less than 1 month long) were not associated with developing colds, severe chronic stressors (1 month or longer) were associated with a substantial increase in risk of disease. This relation was attributable primarily to under- or unemployment and to enduring interpersonal difficulties with family or friends. The association between chronic stressors and susceptibility to colds could not be fully explained by differences among stressed and nonstressed persons in social network characteristics, personality, health practices, or prechallenge endocrine or immune measures.

It throws light on the strategies of a broker who specialized in relations with the royal tribunal of Granada (Real Chancilleria), and on his position within the local community. The article describes the interactions between local networks, the development of a more professionalized legal culture and the growing importance of royal jurisdiction within the Spanish society of the 18th century. The author concludes that the reorganization of bureaucratic relations into patron-client ties shaped particular patterns of state-building. This was, however, not characteristic of a traditional rural world, but, on the contrary, part of efficient and rational strategies, that allowed active participation in the formation of a national political sphere.

The framework is compatible with most of the existing research and theoretical views, and pays attention to some lacunas in these views. The central concept is integrity, i.e., the ways in which the process of situated individual functioning is organized in a niche, consisting of a limited set of situations. Integrity refers to the internal integration of individual functioning and the integration of the individual in his or her niche land thereby in an organization and society at large). Integrity is a multileveled process with considerable individual variation, characterized by signification, morality, and individual experiences, which, with the help of four auxiliary verbs, can be analyzed in terms of individual options for action. Inadequate integrity may result from underdevelopment, decay, change, and intrusions by external events or an ongoing stress process. These can be described as (overlapping, and often coinciding) stress sources. In this respect, the framework makes a distinction between stressors that primarily affect the task itself and stressors that disturb the immediate environment of the task. All these stressors can be described as a matter of too much or too little on a great number of variables, of which usually only the medium range is conducive to adequate integrity. Lastly, attention is paid to stress reactions, which can act as stressors in their own right.

To determine the best provider and the most effective format for a nutrition intervention targeting patients with low Literacy skills, we conducted interviews with literacy experts and health care providers and focus groups with members of adult basic education classes. Thirty-five literacy experts and health-center-based physicians, nurses, and nutritionists in Boston, Mass, were interviewed. In addition, 50 volunteer clients from 4 Boston-based adult basic education programs participated in 6 focus groups. Results suggested that health care providers consider nutrition to be a fundamental health education topic, but that its successful inculcation in patients with limited literacy skills is hindered mostly by insufficient provider time. Almost all providers agreed that patients need to be referred to nutritionists for nutrition education. Although most providers and patients acknowledged that patients perceive physicians to be the authorities on health, patients with low literacy skills turned first to family members and friends for health information. These results suggest that effective nutrition interventions must build on patients' social networks; appear in a visually based, interactive format; and be culturally appropriate.

DESIGN: Of the 1473 randomly selected people aged 65 years and older living in Settsu, Osaka Prefecture, in October 1992, 1405 were contacted. Data for assessment of intellectual dysfunctioning were obtained from 1383 people (98.4%), who constituted the study cohort. Follow-up for 42 months was completed for 1300 subjects (94.0%; 1117 living, 183 deceased). MEASURES: Data on general health status, history of health management, psychosocial conditions, and intellectual dysfunctioning were collected by means of interviews during home visits at the time of enrollment. Intellectual dysfunctioning was determined with the assessment instrument developed by the Social Survey Division of the Office of Population Censuses (OPCS) in Great Britain. RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that the estimated survival rates for men and women decreased with a decline in intellectual function in two age groups: 65 to 74 and 75 years and older. For both sexes, the log rank test showed that the curves among the four groups based on intellectual dysfunctioning (intact, mild, moderate, and severe) achieved statistical significance for the age group of 75 years and older. For both age groups and each of the levels of intellectual dysfunctioning, the estimated survival rate for men was lower than that for women. Application of the Cox proportional hazards model resulted in unadjusted hazard ratios of mild, moderate, and severe intellectual dysfunctioning for mortality of 1.68, 2.44, and 5.37, respectively. Multivariate analysis on the other hand, yielded adjusted hazard ratios of mild, moderate, and severe intellectual dysfunctioning of 1.19, 1.12, and 1.74, respectively, leaving severe dysfunctioning as the only statistically significant factor associated with mortality. Other factors such as sex, age, general health status, history of manage ment, and psychosocial conditions were controlled. CONCLUSION: Intellectual dysfunctioning, as measured by an assessment instrument developed by OPCS, represents an increased risk factor for mortality among community-residing older people.

We used tbe 1994 Alameda County Study survey of 2,537 subjects aged 50-102 to analyze associations between two forms of religiosity and depression as well as the extent to which religiosity buffers relationships between stressors and depression. Non-organizational religiosity included prayer and importance of religious and spiritual beliefs; organizational religiosity included attendance at services and other activities. Non-organizational religiosity had Ilo association with depression; organizational religiosity bad a negative relationship that weakened slightly with the addition of health controls. Both forms of religiosity buffered associations with depression Sol non-family stressors, such as financial and health problems. However, non-organizational religiosity exacerbated associations with depression for child problems, and organizational religiosity exacerbated associations,with depression for marital problems, abuse, and caregiving. Religiosity may help those experiencing non-family stressors, but may worsen matters for those facing family crises.

This literature assumes that network resources, networking activities and network support are heavily used to establish new firms (network founding hypothesis). Further, those entrepreneurs who can refer to a broad and diverse social network and who receive much support from their network are more successful (network success hypothesis). Based on a study of 1,700 new business ventures in Upper Bavaria (Germany), the article gives an empirical test of the network success hypothesis. It is argued that one reason, why previous studies did not consistently find positive network effects, may be that social capital (network support) is used to compensate shortfalls of other types of capital (human capital and financial capital). This compensation hypothesis, however, does not find empirical confirmation. On the other hand, however, the network success hypothesis proves to be valid in our analyses, i.e. network support increases the probability of survival and growth of newly founded businesses.

The spouses felt they were in a situation of overall severe crisis (i.e., experiencing feelings of distress, restrictions, and limited or lack of port). The analysis revealed three family types: the couple acting as a unit, the couple acting independently on equal terms, and the couple acting separately with the spouse in a subordinate position. The spouses' evaluation of the entire experience varied according to the family type and the spouses' personal resources, which influenced the availability and utilization of their social network as well as the support of health-care staff Contentment was related to the couple acting as a unit or the couple acting independently on equal terms and taking control over the situation, actively asking for support and requiring the staff to meet their needs. Discontentment was related to subordination of the spouse to the partner or to health-care staff and failure of the couple to obtain support between them or from others. Empowering the spouses may mean helping them develop their skills, providing them I vith opportunities and authority, and assisting them in gaining access to resources based on know,ledge of the family type, the con,sent of the partner, and the spouse's freedom to make choices. This may well lead to increased efficiency and have positive effects for the patient, for the spouse, and for them both as a couple.

In particular, it calls for wider use of self-report data and sample matching techniques to augment current measures of program effectiveness. It also emphasizes the inclusion of measures on offenders' community reintegration and the involvement of their social networks during and after treatment. More important, future studies should also examine how nonprogrammatic factors tie., staff commitment, staff/client interactions, and community setting) may affect the outcomes. An integrated evaluation paradigm is suggested.	Calif State Univ San Marcos, San Marcos, CA 92069 USA	Zhang, SX (reprint author), Calif State Univ San Marcos, San Marcos, CA 92069 USA.

The authors asked a nationally representative sample of respondents how many people they knew in a list of 32 subpopulations, including 29 subpopulations of known size and 3 of unknown size. Using these responses, the authors produced an effectively unbiased maximum likelihood estimate of the number of people each respondent knows. These estimates were then used to back-estimate the size of the three populations of unknown size. Maximum likelihood values and 95% confidence intervals are found for seroprevalence, 800,000 +/- 43,000; for homeless, 526,000 +/- 35,000; and for women raped in the last 12 months, 194,000 +/- 21,000. The estimate for seroprevalence agrees strikingly with medical estimates, the homeless estimate is well within the published estimates, and the authors' estimate lies in the middle of the published range for rape victims.

A support provision score was regressed on two sets of background control variables: personal characteristics and housing factors; social network variables; and an exchange measure-perceived available support. The hierarchical multivariate results revealed that it was principally the perceived support measure along with two personal characteristics (younger age and nonreligious orientation) that explained the variance in the support provision score (R-2 =.52). The findings underscore the importance of reciprocity within the informal networks of this population.

Nine subjects who suffer from severe mental illness were interviewed, all subjects felt befriending was helpful to them, and 67% of subjects thought it had improved their confidence when in social situations.

The term "grandfamily" was coined to easily identify families in which children are raised by grandparents. Grandchildren in these families are called "grandkin." Grandparents who raise their grandkin tend to have elevated levels of stress that negatively impact their well-being. Grandkin tend to develop problems with attachment and establishing social networks, which can lead to poor psychological adjustment and development. Grandparents who raise their grandchildren significantly influence the development of their grandkin in the school environment. Often the children experience severe academic and behavioral problems in school. This article provides a review of the literature about grandkin and grandparents in grandfamilies, particularly as the relationship influences the children's school functioning. In addition, the Grandfamily School Support Network is discussed as a means of ameliorating the difficulties experienced by grandkin and grandparents. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

I assume that there is a negative association between cross-race relations and relational stability. I examine the extent to which this negative association is rooted in the interpersonal dynamics within the relation itself or in the pressures derived from third party actors associated with the focal actors. I find that race matters. Cross-race relations are more fragile than comparable same-race relations. However, I find that race matters most when a focal alter is a racial isolate in an individual's social network. I conclude that the negative association between cross-race relations and relational stability is rooted in dynamics around the relation with the racial isolate and not within the relation itself.

It extends prior research, which has primarily considered alliances as dyadic exchanges and paid less attention to the fact that key precursors, processes, and outcomes associated with alliances can be destined and shaped in important ways by the social networks within which most firms are embedded. It identifies Jive key issues for the study of alliances: (1) the formation of alliances, (2) the choice of governance structure, (3) the dynamic evolution of alliances, (4) the performance of alliances, and (5) the performance consequences for firms entering alliances. For each of these issues, this paper outlines some of the current research and debates at the firm and dyad level and then discusses some of the new and important insights that result from introducing a network perspective. It highlights current network research on alliances and suggests an agenda for future research. (C) 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Although the literature assumes that this probability depends solely on how close the election is, logically it depends jointly on how many votes are needed to affect the outcome (closeness) and on how many additional votes elite efforts are likely to garner (vote yield). Because the vote yield of mobilizational effort varies with the social capital of the district that elites face, the level of elite mobilizational effort (hence turnout) should depend interactively on closeness and social capital. The authors test their predictions using data from Japanese lower house elections for the years 1967-90. Japan is an interesting test case both because its (former) electoral system differs from that for which the model was first developed and because the literature clearly stresses the role of elite mobilization through social networks but does not examine the particular hypotheses advanced here.

The purpose of this study was to gain insight into attitudes and perceptions about smoking during pregnancy, passive smoke exposure, barriers to quitting, and program preferences among women in a low-income, ethnically diverse setting Design. Nine focus group discussions were conducted with African-American, Native American, and white women. Discussions were moderated by local residents who shared the same ethnic background as group participants. Setting. Discussions were held in neighborhood centers and clinics in an urban area. Subjects. A total of 57 women participated Moderators recruited participants from within their social networks and from neighborhood programs. The informal process of recruitment did not allow calculation of response rates. Measures. A series of open-ended questions with selected probes was used to guide the conversation. Results. Participants were aware that smoking during pregnancy is harmful and were concerned to varying degrees about their smoking behavior. Most women who smoked took active steps to reduce the risks. Actions were frequently accompanied by beliefs that rationalized moderate levels of smoking. While concerned, women were uncertain about what constituted harmful, passive smoke exposure. Personal barriers to quitting included being around others who smoked, feelings of stress and boredom, addiction, and not believing smoking is dangerous enough. Participants fended to value pregnancy-related advice from female friends and relatives over advice from professionals. Conclusions. Results suggest that many women respond to warnings about smoking during pregnancy but actions are not necessarily measured in quit rates. Misconceptions about the risks may help to rationalize continued smoking. Subjects lacked knowledge about how best to reduce the risks of passive smoke. Educational efforts may be effective when directed at networks of women who share information. The nature of qualitative data collection prevents extrapolation of these results to a larger population.

However, focusing upon weak ties as one important type of interracial contact, we show how reallocation of students among schools for desegregation may reduce opportunities for interracial contact. We analyze this apparent paradox and show that it is a member of the mathematical family of phenomena known as class size paradoxes. Then, we consider policy implications for schools and theoretical implications for understanding intergroup relations, and we suggest the need for empirical research to determine the practical value of applying the theory in this complex context.

The purpose of this study is to show the differences in mortality from the leading causes of death by marital status among men and women in Spain. An analysis was made of persons aged 25 years and older who died in Spain during 1991. The mortality differences by marital status and sex were analysed for all the deaths and for the most frequent causes of death, using the ratios of age adjusted death rates calculated from Poisson log-linear models. For both men and women, mortality was always higher in single and widowed persons than in married persons, except for a non-statistically significant mortality from diabetes mellitus and cirrhosis of the liver in single women. Divorced and separated men had a higher mortality than married men for all the causes of death taken together; the mortality among divorced and separated women, on the other hand, was lower than in married women. Divorced and separated men and women generally had a lower mortality than married persons for the different causes of death, except for traffic accidents, suicide, cirrhosis of the liver and HIV infection, where it was higher. The results obtained are similar to the findings of most studies in other countries, in which a lower mortality has been observed in married persons as compared to those who are widowed or single. However, the data showing that divorced and separated persons have a tower mortality from some causes of death than married persons stand in contrast to most published studies. This work has shown that unmarried persons are not a homogeneous group, in that divorced and separated persons are very different from those who are single or widowed.

A random sample of 1,500 Kuwaiti citizens, surveyed in 1994, provided data on individuals' status differences, their religious beliefs and practices and their embeddeness into social networks which are sources of attitude support and formation. OLS regression analysis demonstrated that Islamic orthodoxy was compatible with extending women's rights while Islamic religiosity was not, regardless of the respondents' sects. Respondents occupying positions of social status were more inclusive. However, respondents' ties to the social system around them predicted differently for members of Sunni and Shia sects. Also, intrasect differences probably reflected respondents' connections to different schools of Islamic thought in different geographical locations which hold differing ideas and opinions regarding the place of women.

In addition to questions on substance use, the participants responded to questionnaires covering behavior and emotions, life events, self-related cognitions, coping capacities, perceived parental behavior, perceived school environment, and the social network. The gender gap in substance use tended to close with increasing age. Parental substance use served as a model for substance use in the participants. Substance users had more abnormal scores on almost all variables as compared to abstaining controls. Lack of acceptance and control, pressure to achieve at school, and life events significantly predicted substance use. The latter served as a moderating risk variable for delinquent behavior under stress.

To assess everyday life stress and emotional adjustment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and their children. Methods. We conducted a 6 month study of 14 patients with RA with children aged 4-16 years (25 children) and 24 control families (53 children). Life event stress and functional capacity were assessed at the beginning and end of the study, and minor stressors (hassles), positive events (uplifts), and salivary cortisol were recorded weekly. Emotional adjustment was measured monthly in adults by self-report, and bimonthly in children using the Child Behavior Checklist (completed by parents), Social support and psychological coping responses were also measured. Results. Patients with RA experienced fewer positive events than did controls, and they tended to have smaller support networks. Daily hassle levels correlated with severity of disability, and differences in psychological coping were also observed. Children from RA families reported nearly 50% more hassles per week than did controls, and their social networks were significantly smaller. They were rated as having greater problems of social adjustment than controls. Cortisol concentration was greater among children who experienced more life event stress over the study period, but did not differ between groups. Conclusion. The patients with RA in this study showed good adaptation, but experienced less pleasure in their daily lives, The children of patients with RA may have heightened vulnerability to stress related problems, with fewer social resources and difficulties in behavioral adjustment.

We hypothesized that men who judge others to be unreceptive to their attempts to talk about their cancer-related concerns would have poorer mental health than men with more receptive social networks. In a survey with 178 prostate cancer survivors, we measured intrusive thoughts about cancer, social constraints in talking about cancer, avoidance in thinking and talking about cancer, anti mental health. There were significant interactive effects of Family/Friend Social Constraints x Intrusive Thoughts and Wife Social Constraints x Intrusive Thoughts on mental health. Plots of the interactions showed a stronger negative relation between intrusive thoughts and mental health among men who felt socially constrained in talking about their cancer than among men who felt unconstrained. In addition, level of constraints from family and friends was positively associated with level of avoidance in thinking and talking about cancer which, in turn, was associated with poorer mental health. These results suggest that supportive social networks may promote psychological adjustment by facilitating cognitive processing of the cancer experience.

I focus on the districts of Matutuine and Namaacha where the war was profoundly shaped by the dual influences of the international borders and the capital city. Though the intensity of the government's military response prevented rebel control of sizeable populations inside the country, the borders allowed Rename to develop crucial international networks of support in South Africa and Swaziland: this strategy and the social networks upon which it relied meant that Rename's relationship with civilians and alliances with chiefs were significantly different from those described in the existing literature. I show Rename's social base in the so-called 'zones of destruction' to be more complex than hitherto understood, particularly in so far as the rebels were able to - or tried to - win a constituency other than youth. Stereotypes in the existing literature of a wartime social and spacial polarisation between rural, traditionalist Rename communities living in isolation from the market and modem, urban society loyal to the government are inadequate and misleading: not only were Rename soldiers and allied civilians deeply imbricated in the cross border economy, but soldiers of both sides had common interests in controlling movement and wartime trade. As the capital's fuel needs soared during the war, groups of young men left the capital and moved into the city's hinterland to burn charcoal. Replacing local communities displaced by the war, these government controlled charcoal burning settlements were dominated by uneducated male youth who cut to get quick profits, gained a reputation for violence, and brought about an increasingly predatory relationship between the capital city and its hinterland.

Data used for this study come from the Taiwan Survey of Health & Living Status of the Elderly (1989). The research decomposes the effect of education into the direct effect and the indirect effects by means of health status, health behaviors, and social relationships. We have shown that of the total effect of educational attainment on the mortality of older Taiwanese, about 83% represents indirect influences by means of the 3 mediating factors, particularly health status. On the other hand, the magnitude of the direct effect, which might reflect influences of additional intervening variables on old-age mortality, is low and not statistically significant. The results demonstrate that the apparent strong effect of education on mortality among older Taiwanese can be accounted for parsimoniously through 3 major pathways.

Fieldwork in non-metropolitan Mexico demonstrates the utility of our model, which can be applied across both urban and non-urban domains. It is compatible with the Milroys' central mechanism for the description of individual speech usage and group cohesion or susceptibility to change in terms of the social network. Based on linguistic variable types, this model has a hierarchy of four nested fields (speech community configurations) into which each individual is placed, according to his/her demonstrated recognition of the social evaluation associated with the variables. At the most local configuration, speakers demonstrate no knowledge of generally stigmatized variables; in the second, speakers register an awareness of stigmatized variables; in the third, an awareness of stigmatized and regional variables; and in the fourth, speakers model standard variants over regional ones.

This endogenous clock naturally runs more slowly than the solar day and is entrained to a 24-h rhythm primarily by the alternation of Light and darkness. Jet lag, shift-work sleep disorder, and some of the chronic insomnias are caused by a temporal discrepancy of the body clock relative to the surrounding environment and social network. The underlying mechanisms and general management are described. Both bright light and melatonin therapy have potential in the management of these disorders. Traditionally, bright Light therapy has been used to alleviate the depression associated with seasonal affective disorder. Melatonin has received much ill-formed publicity, it being claimed that it is a panacea and an 'anti-ageing' treatment. Both of these treatment approaches are reviewed.

Risk in this population is associated with high prevalence of unprotected sex with multiple, casual or high-risk sexual partners; high levels of sexual contact between men with severe mental illness and other men use of injection drugs or sexual contact within injection drug user (IDU) social networks elevated rates of alcohol and noninjected drug use, especially the use of crack: cocaine and the exchange of sex for drugs; and patterns of "survival sex" to obtain food, money, or a place to stay. A number of theoretical models have been developed to guide HIV risk behavior change interventions, This paper describes the theoretical underpinnings of skills-based HIV risk reduction interventions and the elements critical to successful HIV risk behavior damage as delineated by this model, We then discuss how these elements were operationalized in an HIV prevention intervention successfully implemented in urban community mental health clinics serving people with mental illness. Effective, theory-driven HIV prevention interventions can be successfully incorporated into the daily service life of community-based mental health clinics.

Methods: Out of 236 melanoma patients, who constitute a representative sample of melanoma patients in Western Austria, 215 patients participated in the study and were assessed with regard to psychosocial distress, coping strategies, social networks and interest in receiving psychosocial support. Multiple logistic regression analyses were performed with regard to patient interest in receiving psychosocial support either from the attending oncologist or from a mental health professional. Results: 65 patients (30.2%) experienced moderate and 30 patients (14.0%) severe distress, which was predominantly caused by tumour-related fears, tension and disturbance of emotional well-being. 83% of the severely distressed patients wanted psychosocial support from their oncologists, whereas only half of them were interested in additional support from a psychotherapist. In particular, patients who showed fear of tumour progression and felt that they were insufficiently informed about their disease preferred to consult their dermatologist for psychosocial support. On the other hand, patients with poor prognosis, receiving only low levels of support from their social network, and exhibiting a depressive coping style, showed interest in getting supplementary support from a psychotherapist. Conclusions: These findings underline the importance of educating oncologists with a view both to improve their communication skills and to help them identify patients making poor adjustment to illness in order to offer them appropriate emotional support.

Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that the impact of stressful events involving social networks was buffered by satisfying relationships at Time 1 and self-esteem, Satisfying relations al Time 1 also lessened the impact of work stressors on depressive symptoms.

In the six year period between the 1989 and 1995 surveys, four of the five communities were impacted by major events, including the introduction of corporate hog production in two places and flooding in two others. However, despite these events, there is a high degree of continuity in the relative viability scores of the five places in the two surveys. Leaders in more viable places continue to work with a larger number of fellow leaders and to be more involved in community development organizations than their counterparts in less viable places. These findings show the importance of social capital for rural community viability.

This technique may not make full use of contextual data that an ethnographic and social network approach can offer. Goals of the Study: The occasion of a syphilis outbreak among young people was used to investigate the applicability of a social network approach and to test the validity of several traditional approaches to syphilis epidemiology. Study Design: An outbreak of syphilis was investigated by interviewing both infected and noninfected people, by directing resources based on network association, by creating and evaluating network diagrams as an aid to the epidemiologic process, and by including ethnographic observations as part of outbreak management. Results: Diagrammatic display of network growth provided a useful alternative to the traditional epidemic curve. Case prevention was demonstrated by identifying uninfected people with multiple concurrent exposures. Concurrent, overlapping exposure in infected people rendered traditional "source" and "spread" criteria moot. Conclusions: The current discussions of partner notification may be informed by recognizing that it is a subset of a broader and potentially more powerful approach. This approach calls some basic tenets of syphilis epidemiology into question.

This study uses ethnographic data from a black middle-class neighborhood in Chicago to explore how residents manage this ecological context I find that dense social networks fostered by residential stability facilitate the informal supervision of neighborhood youth and enhance the activities of formal organizations and institutions. Nevertheless the incorporation of gang members and drug dealers into the networks of law-abiding kin and neighbors thwarts efforts to completely rid the neighborhood of its criminal element. The conflicting effects of dense networks challenge traditional social organization theory.

Data from 46 outpatients with schizophrenia were analysed using structural equation modelling to test plausible sets of interrelationships between social skill, social networks, and social support. The data supported a tentative model about the causal relationships between variables. Paths showed that people with greater social skill had larger social networks, but did not necessarily perceive greater support from these networks. Negative symptoms accounted for some of the effect of social skill on social networks. Whereas groups of single-admission and multiple-admission participants did not differ in terms of social skill, social networks, or support, the age of the participants influenced their social skill and the size of their social networks. Younger participants had greater social skill and larger social networks. The results appear to suggest the importance of early intervention for young people with first-episode psychosis.

Although friendships across groups were not significantly related to perceptions of intergroup conflict, negative relationships were associated with higher perceived intergroup conflict. Perceptions of intergroup conflict were also significantly related to indirect relationships through friends, and an amplification effect was uncovered. Finally, low intragroup cohesiveness was significantly related to higher perceptions of intergroup conflict.

I present a dynamic and variable portrayal of networks to demonstrate how they gradually assume different forms and functions for women and for men that differentially affect settlement outcomes, particularly opportunities to become legal. The gendered social relations of neighborhood, work, and voluntary associations interact to produce this outcome. The conclusions suggest that social networks can both strengthen and weaken over time, can change differentially for different segments of the immigrant community, and therefore can have disparate effects on incorporation.

Multiple regression;analyses indicated that, after taking the influence of demographic variables, disease activity and pain,into account, a decrease in functional status (mobility, self-care, grip strength) after 1 yr could be predicted by an initially more;frequent use of the passive pain-coping strategies of worrying and-resting. A decrease in mobility could be additionally predicted by an initially smaller social network. Results indicate the impact of passive pain-coping strategies and social network characteristics for the prognosis of functional outcome in the first stage of the disease and suggest the early;manifestation of avoidance mechanisms; including behavioral, cognitive-emotional and social components, in face of a chronic stressor.

Ln Study 1, the definition, measurement, and structure of the social competence construct are evaluated in 2 samples of children. For Study 1A, 167 4-year-old children were assessed with a battery of observation, interview, and Q-sort measures. Relations among the measures suggested a hierarchical structure that was tested using a structural equation model. Results from the analysis supported the conjecture that social competence should be viewed as a hierarchically organized construct. In Study 1B, the model was tested again for a group of 3- and 4-year-old children (it = 265), using a modified set of measures. The general structure of the model from Study 1A was reproduced in this independent sample, although paths from the second-order factor to lower-order factors were not perfectly coordinated across samples. Ln Study 2, data for a subset of the children in Study 1B (n = 182), gathered with respect to features of their social networks, were examined to assess the structure of their social support networks. Descriptive and structural equation analyses are reported. Sixty nine of these children were observed at home with their mothers and described using the Waters Attachment Q-sort. A structural equation model testing relations consistent with causal pathways from attachment security to both social support networks and to social competence and from the social support network variable to social competence with peers fit these data with a high degree of confidence. Subsequent analyses locating social competence as antecedent to attachment security were not significant. We conclude that the construct domains of social competence and social support networks can be meaningfully measured for preschool children and that individual differences with respect to these construct domains are related to child-parent relationship qualities.

These programs must be community based and supported in order to succeed. The Zuni Diabetes Prevention Program (Program) is a community-based primary prevention project designed to reduce the prevalence of diabetes risk factors among high-school-age youths. The Program strives to enhance knowledge of diabetes and to support increased physical activity, increased fruit and vegetable intake, and reduced soft drink consumption. The primary mechanisms of intervention are diabetes education, a school-based wellness center, supportive social networks, and modification of the food supply available to teens. Program evaluation uses a multiple cross-sectional model; assessment occurs at three points within the 4-year project. Midproject results indicate a significant reduction in soft drink consumption and an increase in glucose/insulin ratios, suggesting a decline in the incidence of hyperinsulinemia.

Program success is explained by the ability to develop skills demanded by industry while becoming part of employers' own, trusted recruiting networks. These findings suggest the importance of social networks (connecting job seekers to employers) to the design of training programs.

We found significant group differences. (1) White men were more vulnerable to social network losses than White women; (2) Work stressors had long-term effects on African American men whose levels of depressive symptoms were also elevated by poor health and retirement; and (3) The influence of income was more dominant among African Americans and its effect was greater for African American women.

Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions for the P-year period 1988 through 1989 were used. In this survey, a probability sample of the Swedish population aged 16 years and older was interviewed. Persons with headache were identified by the question, "Have you (during the last 2 weeks) had recurrent headache or migraine?" Analgesic use was defined by the question, "Have you (during the last 2 weeks) used prescription or nonprescription analgesics?" Persons who answered both these questions were included in the present study, yielding a study population of 11 975 persons. Sixteen percent of all women and 8.2 percent of all men reported headache. Seventy-four percent of all women with headache reported analgesic use as compared to 64% of all men with headache. Analgesic use increased with increasing age among women but not men. While few of the studied factors were associated with analgesic use among persons with headache, the associations found differed by gender. Poor social network and musculoskeletal pain were associated with analgesic use among men with headache; age, being underweight, and visits to a physiotherapist were associated with analgesic use among women with headache. Those studying medication use among persons with headache might consider including these factors in future studies to help better understand the mechanisms behind the decision to use or avoid analgesics.

Verbatim transcriptions were analysed using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach and the following were found to be reflected on: the pensioners' personal situation--disease-related behaviour, ADL-functions, social network and self-esteem; the pensioners' environment - their relationships to significant others, adequate level of housing/care, access to activities, and satisfactory personal space; pensioner/staff interaction - their relations to each other, the staffs' relation to the pensioners' family, and the balance between reality-orientation vs. validation; the staff's situation-co-operation with other professionals, in primary health care, hospital, and within the social services; job satisfaction, lack of knowledge and sharing of knowledge, and lack of resources, especially time. The reasoning of the participants under supervision was found to be based on medical, historical, psychological, and environmental explanations, or personal beliefs. Feelings explored during supervision were directed towards the pensioners or the pensioners' families, towards themselves or towards the management. The findings were interpreted within a nursing model based on the four central concepts of nursing; person, environment, nursing intervention and health. The reasoning about nursing care revealed in the supervision sessions reflected a holistic approach and the relationship between the staff and the demented person stood out as central for care quality. Thus focusing on what promotes or, respectively, obstructs this relationship is likely to be one important focus in clinical supervision not only to achieve improvement and high quality in home care but also to develop and enhance the quality of the working life of the staff. Since the results could be understood within a theoretical nursing care model, it may well be that if the supervisor functions within some theoretical model the participants may reach a more conscious approach and the risk of losing important aspects of caring will decrease.

JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS			English	Article						older adults; reciprocity; social networks; social support	SOCIAL SUPPORT; RECIPROCITY	Exchange theory assumes that people strive towards a balance in their personal relationships. The question is why the balance is not restored in unbalanced relationships where older adults receive more instrumental support than they give. The data are from a longitudinal study of 408 older adults and 2044 of their network members. At T-1, the older adults received more instrumental support than they gave in 335 (17%) of their relationships. The instrumental support balance in these relationships at T, was also assessed. The results of a multilevel regression analysis show that network members continue giving support to older adults who are in poor health. If the network member is in poor health, the balance is likely to be restored. Four other reasons for continuing the imbalance were also examined. No evidence was found to back the idea that a lack of instrumental reciprocity could be compensated by the older adults giving more emotional support. The second hypothesis (that close relationships often involve social norms that make it difficult to withdraw from unreciprocated support giving) was confirmed: in kin relationships and friendships, the imbalance persisted over time, while neighbor and other non-kin relationships returned to balance. Thirdly, it was hypothesized that if there were a small number of alternative supporters, it would be hard to withdraw from unreciprocated support giving. However, it was found that if the network was small, the imbalance was not likely to endure. Finally, as predicted, if there was generalized network reciprocity, the balance in particular relationships was not restored.

I begin with the network structure of social capital, explaining the information and control benefits of structural holes. The holes in a network are entrepreneurial opportunities to add value, and persons rich in such opportunities are expected to be more successful than their peers. Accumulating empirical research supports the prediction. However, women here pose a puzzle. The entrepreneurial networks linked to early promotion for senior men do not work for women. Solving the gender puzzle is an occasion to see how network models of social capital can be used to identify people not accepted as legitimate members of a population, and to describe how such people get access to social capital by borrowing the network of a strategic partner.

Ratings by the two groups were significantly correlated, suggesting that the reports of wife caregivers may be considered valid. Supportive others rated physical help received by wife caregivers significantly higher than did the caregivers. Nondepressed caregivers perceived themselves to be significantly healthier than their supportive others perceived them. Depressed caregivers reported larger social networks than did their supportive others. Findings point to the importance of gaining the perspectives of both primary and secondary caregivers in order to understand the total reality of the caregiving situation.

We explore the effects of gender ethnicity, other social statuses, and role configurations on informal social network characteristics in an analysis of a U.S. sample of adults, of which 14% are ethnic/racial minorities. Specifically, we examine the extent to which gender ethnicity, and social roles influence the structural and dynamic characteristics of social networks.

The procedure revealed that the more resourceful diversified and friend and neighbor network types were consistently associated with better scores on measures of basic and instrumental activities of daily living, incontinence, vision and self-rated health, even when controlling for respondents' age, sex and education. The religious family network type, also endowed with considerable support potential, tended to correlate with lower health scores. The narrow family focused network had average health ratings or less, and a moderate support capability. The least resourceful network type, the attenuated network, was most frequently associated with poor health. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

We studied (1) subjective well-being (SWB) as a latent variable in a common-factor model with four items, (2) the reliability of these four items, and (3) variables related to SWB in stroke patients. Methods-Data on all stroke patients (n=1417) and a random subsample of stroke-free individuals of similar age (n=1439) were collected from the Nord-Trondelag Health Survey, a cross-sectional study of 74977 persons. Based on a two-sample factor analysis model, scores of SWB were calculated, and variables explaining SWB were studied in a regression model. Resulfs-Four items were a priori believed to measure SWB as a latent variable ("satisfaction," "strength," "calmness," and "cheerfulness"). This was confirmed by factor analysis. The reliability of these items (the proportion of the variance of the items that can be explained by the common factor) was between .42 and .53. Regression analyses showed a significant effect of having had a stroke, gender (lower SWB in men), age (increasing SWB with increasing age), perceived general health, nervousness, loneliness, sleep problems, social support, and use of analgesics. There was no statistical interaction between these variables and having had a stroke. Conclusions-Higher SWB after stroke relates to female gender, older age, good general and mental health, and a firm social network.

We extend this examination by addressing a largely ignored perspective that focuses on the relationships among actors. Drawing on social network analysis, we generate propositions concerning types of relationships (strength, multiplexity, asymmetry, and status) and the structure of relationships (structural holes, centrality, and density). We also consider the combination of the type and structure of relationships and how this embeddedness perspective relates to social contagion and conspiracies.

Of the full set of interviews, matched sub-samples of twelve reports from each country were analysed qualitatively. Examples of the support received, or lacked, by two relatives are first presented in some detail. The main sub-categories of support, or its lack, described in the twenty-four reports are then presented. Finally a preliminary comparison of data from the two countries is also reported. As well as providing a derailed picture of types of support (e.g, emotional, material) that are familiar from studies with other populations, this paper also emphasizes the importance of the close relative's perception of the relationship between the alcohol or drug user and the supportive or unsupportive 'other: and describes a range of circumstances under which relatives are denied support. Preliminary support is obtained for the hypothesis that Mexican social networks would be more dominated by kin and neighbours, whilst English relatives would draw for support upon more diverse networks.

The three groups differed significantly in endorsement of various reasons for abstaining, When the three groups of abstainers were compared to each other, to infrequent drinkers and to other current drinkers on demographic and psychosocial variables, it was found that lifetime abstainers and infrequent drinkers who abstained during the previous 12 months tended to be older, less educated and more religious than former and current drinkers. Current drinkers were more likely than all groups of abstainers to own their own home, had larger social networks and engaged in more social activities. Former drinkers reported more stress, greater depression, and lower sense of coherence than current drinkers ann other types of abstainers. These results demonstrate the importance of distinguishing different types of abstainers, since the conclusions regarding differences between drinkers and nondrinkers are likely to depend on the relative proportions of each type of abstainer in the sample.

The formation of the cotton textile machinery and firearms industrial districts in New England between 1790 and 1820 demonstrates the importance of initial conditions, including general education and skills levels, a growing economy, prosperous people, and social networks that communicate information and support cooperative ventures. The bridges across social networks of personnel and firms provide the means to acquire new technology. Internal social cohesion within a network supports exchanges, but even more critical to long-term growth of an industrial district are the bridges across social networks that have minimal redundancy. Those types of contacts maximize the diversity of information and open new possibilities for contacts. The cotton textile machinery and firearms industries in New England emerged in a prosperous agricultural economy with a deep set of skills in metalworking. Those preexisting metalworking skills supported growth and technological change in the new industries. At the same time, the new industries added to the richness of metalworking skills and the social networks that tied personnel and firms.

Loan servicing and collection procedures within the organizations were examined. Findings suggest that several organizational factors of nonprofit lenders are related to their loan delinquency rates: social networks, business culture, funding sources, composition of the board and loan committees, staff structure, loan intake, and collection tools. The study also finds that the nonprofit sector's institutional environment and its partnership with the private sector in a mutually beneficial process influence the loan delinquency rate. More specifically, active participation of local bankers in NeighborWorks(1) loan committees, diverse funding sources (from both the public and private sectors), and a diffusion of business practices through dense social networks are related to NeighborWorks' loan servicing and collection policy and procedures. These factors in turn influence NeighborWorks' rehabilitation loan delinquency rates.

Investment was operationalized as enjoyment in Study 1 and as preference for interaction in Study 2. In the first study, four- and six-year-old children's enjoyment of peer interaction was observed in 26 groups of same-sex peers. Girls were rated as enjoying their interactions significantly hiss than boys. In the second study, six- and nine-year-old children were interviewed about the individuals with whom they spend time in their homes and neighborhoods and about the individuals who participate in their favorite activities. The proportion of individuals named by children who were peers was significantly lower for girls than boys both in children's neighborhoods and in children's favorite activities. Results strongly support the hypothesis that females and males have evolved differential preferences for interaction with peers.

The first part was published in (FID no. 2 and dealt with the scholarly communication model. The second part will deal with the scholarly communication process. In recent years there has been a resurgence of interest both in scholarly communication as a research area and in the application of bibliometrics as a research method This article discusses the scholarly communication process from the following three points of view: (I) scholarly communication participants the human element in scholarly communication; (2) scholarly communication media - the carrier element in scholarly communication; (3) information diffusion in scholarly communication - the message element in scholarly communication. Scientific research is all information consuming as well as producing human activity of which output outperforms its input. The study of characteristics of information processes represents a central topic in the discipline of science and also in Bibliometrics. The channels of information either in the classical printed or in electronic form are the scientific journals, which contain about 70 % of the new information, produced in natural sciences. Conditions and intensity of the information flow between persons, teams, institutions, countries, etc. have been widely studied.

Some of these immigrants originated in the Republics adjacent to the Chernobyl Power Plant, site of the 1986 accident. The sample consisted of 708 immigrants who were interviewed between the years 1993/1995 with an average age of 47.5 (sd 11.8). This sample was reinterviewed approximately a year and three months later (n = 520). The sample included two exposure groups-high exposed and low exposed based on the estimated levels of ground cesium contamination from the IAEA maps and a comparison group matched by age, gender, and year of immigration. Those over the age of sixty-five were disadvantaged, compared to those aged fifty to sixty-four, and younger, when it came to the tasks of immigrant absorption; learning the language, working and acquiring an income, and establishing alternative social networks which could offer support in times of illness. The psychological variables showed that over time, somatization, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms related to Chernobyl improved, however at a much slower pace for older immigrants (aged 55 and over) compared to younger ones.

Participants were categorized as borderline hypertensive if screening systolic blood pressure (SBP) fell in the range 130-160 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) fell in the range 85-100 mmHg; BPs below these ranges were considered normotensive. Participants underwent ambulatory BP monitoring. Individuals classified as normotensive reported significantly greater support satisfaction than individuals with borderline hypertension. Social network characteristics were not associated with BP. During 24 hr of ambulatory BP monitoring, high perceived support satisfaction was associated with lower SEP and DBP at work, home, and during sleep. These data suggest that perceived satisfaction with social support is associated with lower BP. The presence of social support also may reduce BP levels during daily life.

Participants in the study were 1,049 actively employed men and women. They filled in 2 questionnaires on health and working conditions and went through a medical examination, including measurements of height, weight, and blood pressure and the drawing of a venous blood sample for determination of-serum lipids, fasting glucose, and plasma fibrinogen. Angina pectoris was assessed by a trained nurse according to the Rose and Blackburn questionnaire method (Rose, Blackburn, Gillum, & Prinea). High job strain was defined as the combination of self-assessed high demands and low control at work. Social status was measured on a 5-point scale. Thirty-five cases of questionnaire positive angina pectoris were identified. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed a significant association (odds ratio = 2.3, p = 0.02) between high job strain and questionnaire positive angina pectoris independently of coronary risk factors. Systolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio, and gender were the only other factors contributing to the final model when a backwards procedure was performed. Entering social network and social status into the analysis did not change the strength of the association. Working hours and few social relationships at work were borderline associated with questionnaire positive angina pectoris.

Support for this argument is based on an examination of the pattern of migration to Hong Kong, a city which plays a significant role in the world economy. Reported here are the results of an analysis of recently released 1996 by-census data, and the authors' interviews with foreign domestic workers in Hong Kong. These findings have shown that highly skilled immigrant workers were drawn largely from developed countries, the main sources of inward investment in this city, while less skilled immigrants were drawn from less developed neighbouring labour markets. While the geographical pattern of immigration followed broadly that predicted from Hong Kong's position in the world economy, the results have revealed that cultural influences such as language and social networks are also important in shaping the economic roles of migrant workers.

The model takes account of the fact that atypical sexual behaviour is usefully conceptualized as occurring not in isolation, but within the context of the youngster's physical, cognitive, moral, social and emotional development and also within the context of the child's overall social network including the family, the peer group and the school. For case management, programme evaluation and research, assessment procedures are therefore developmentally referenced and span a range of domains including peer relationships, coping strategies, social skills, family relationships, taking responsibility far sexual aggression, adherence to treatment, understanding sexual offending behaviour, development of empathy and caring, and relapse prevention. Treatment procedures based on this model, unlike those based on downward extensions of adult offending behaviour programmes, are matched to the youngster's developmental level. They are also comprehensive, integrated, flexible and address general behaviour patterns of which sexual offending is but one.

To date, researchers in this field have tended to focus on positive social influences, such as social support. Furthermore, in most studies, operational definitions of social support have stressed the source of the support (e.g., family support and friend support) rather than the nature of the support provided by these groups and individuals. In order to clarify the social context of physical activity among older adults, more attention should be paid to exploring both positive and negative social influences on physical activity. The objectives of this paper were to consolidate current findings concerning social influences and physical activity among aging adults, and to identify major positive and negative social influences from the literature that are associated with physical activity and health-promoting behaviors among aging adults. The development of a more comprehensive and representative method of measuring social influences in physical activity settings is advocated.

These interviews enabled the identification of a wider sexual network between 154 participants and contacts during the year August 1994-July 1995. The linked network data help to identify pathways of transmission between individuals who are HIV + and those who are HIV -, as well as sexual links between 'older' and 'younger' men, and with male prostitutes. There appears to be considerable on-going transmission of HIV in London. The majority of participants reported having had unprotected anal and/or vaginal sex within a variety of relationships. The implications of these findings for policies designed to prevent the transmission of HIV are discussed.

Drug using youth were recruited from residential and outpatient drug treatment centers. Abstaining youth were recruited from the social networks of the drug using youths and from community organizations that were strongly opposed to drug use. All youths were assessed on several psyche-social variables using a structured interview schedule, a set of questionnaires, and a situational role play test of social skills. First, concurrent validity of the POSIT was tested by comparing POSIT domain scores between these two groups of youth. Based on our analysis, all ten POSIT domain scores for drug using youth were greater than those for the abstaining youth, and nine of the ten were significantly greater. Second, construct validity was evaluated by comparing POSIT domain scores with scores from other instruments. Pearson's bivariate correlations were used to test the convergent validity of the POSIT domains with the same or similar constructs. Strong support for the convergent validity of three domains (Substance Use, Mental Health, Aggressive Behavior/Delinquency), some support for four domains (Physical Health, Family Relations, Educational Status, and Social Skills), and minimal support for three domains (Peer Relations, Vocational Status and Leisure & Recreation) was found. The analysis also indicated discriminant validity of the POSIT domains by generating non-significant correlations with nonrelevant and dissimilar variables.

Useful inference requires flexible probability models for such random graphs; these models should have interpretable location and scale parameters, and support the establishment of confidence regions, maximum likelihood estimates, goodness-of-fit tests, Bayesian inference, and an appropriate analogue of linear model theory. Banks and Carley (1994) develop a simple probability model and sketch some analyses; this paper extends that work so that analysts are able to choose models that reflect application-specific metrics on the see of graphs. The strategy applies to graphs, directed graphs, hypergraphs, and trees, and often extends to objects in countable metric spaces.

This approach differs from traditional research strategies in that the focus is on developing an understanding of the ongoing transactions and the implications of transactional patterns between individuals, groups, or other social units. Although the primary emphasis in SNA is on the social context, network analysts also include traditional individual-differences variables as potential explanatory factors. SNA methods provide the means to derive a more complete view of a given social environment. A group-psychotherapy example is used to provide an overview of SNA, introducing the concepts, notation, and statistical methods used by the current generation of network researchers. Methodological issues are discussed, applications are reviewed, and resources are recommended for those wishing to learn more about SNA.

Altmaier (1998) have presented statistical methods related to Rasch modeling, social network analysis, and latent variable structural equation modeling for experimental designs, respectively. These methods address 3 critically important issues in counseling psychology research: (a) measuring constructs, (b) modeling processes of change, and (c) operationalizing social relations. It is argued that innovation in methods is necessary to study complex phenomena, but sophisticated methods should not be used to disguise insufficient conceptualizations of the research problem.

Numerous theoretical models and empirical studies have attempted to explain the complex factors that lead individuals to use drugs. The Social Stress Model of Substance Abuse [1] is one model developed to explain parameters that influence drug use. According to the model, the likelihood df an individual engaging in drug use is seen as a function of the stress level and the extent to which it is offset by stress modifiers such as social networks, social competencies, and resources. The variables of the denominator are viewed as interacting with each other to buffer the impact of stress [I]. This article focuses on one of the constructs in this model: that of competence. It presents a summary of theoretical and conceptual formulations for the construct of competence, a review of empirical evidence for the association of competence with drug use, and describes the preliminary development of a multiscale instrument designed to assess drug protective competence among low-income Hispanic childbearing women. Based upon theoretical and empirical studies, eight domains of drug protective competence were identified and conceptually defined. Using subscales from existing instruments with psychometric evidence for their validity and reliability, a multi-scale instrument was developed to assess drug protective competence. Hypothesis testing was used to assess construct validity. Four drug protective competence domains (social influence, sociability, self-worth, and control/responsibility) were found to be statistically associated with drug use behaviors. Although not statistically significant, expected trends were observed between drug use and the other four domains of drug protective competence (intimacy, nurturance, goal directedness, and spiritual directedness). Study limitations and suggestions for further psychometric testing of the instrument are described.

We consider a rational model where the needs of the HIV+ population are met by individual resources, public resources, and network resources (family and friendship contributions). In this model, impoverishment of altruistic network members leads to an increase in risky behaviors and a further spread of AIDS. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Setting-Sweden. Design-A random sample of 5798 men and 6072 women aged 55-74 years were interviewed face to face by Statistics Sweden 1986-1993. Dependent variable: impaired mobility and impaired working capacity. Independent variables: sex, age, country of birth (Swedes, Finns, Western countries, south Europeans, and all others), attained level of education, marital status, form of tenure, and social network. This study was designed as a cross sectional study. The data were analysed with unconditional logistic regression in main effect models. The results are shown as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results-In general, poor health, defined as impaired working capacity or impaired mobility, proved to be more frequent among foreign born people and in all socially disadvantaged groups such as those with a low educational status, people renting a dwelling or with a poor social network. Impaired working capacity and impaired mobility were more frequent among female "all others". The impaired mobility among men and women born in south Europe was high with OR=2.65 (CI=1.34, 5.25) and OR=3.17 (CI=1.44, 7.00) in the full model. Men and women from Finland and all other countries had high risks for impaired mobility when adjusted for all background variables. Finnish men and south European women had the highest odds ratios for impaired working capacity. There was a clear gradient between educational status and impaired working capacity, with the highest odds ratios for men and women, 2.39 and 1.92, with a low attained level of education, when adjusting for the independent variables. Conclusion-Country of birth and educational status are two important independent factors with influence on poor health defined as impaired mobility and impaired working capacity in age 55-74.

This paper proposes a model of negotiations that examines how national culture, organization specific factors, and individual characteristics of the negotiators impact the multilateral negotiation process in a cross-national context. Specifically, social network theory and tools are utilized to examine how coalitions form and roles emerge among participants. The model also posits the effect of social network activity on negotiation outcomes. Research propositions are forwarded in hopes of setting an agenda for the research stream implied by the model. Methods for testing the model and implications for academics and managers are also discussed.

A job provides structure to daily life, adds to a sense of self-worth and self-esteem, and is a means of self-expression, all of which define and identify the person. This work activity links individuals to a society and to a social network. When an individual retires, there is a loss of one role and a beginning of a new one. The purpose of this research was to explore the periretirement period of nurses to better understand the transitional process. A qualitative approach was chosen to enable the researchers to explore in-depth perceptions and opinions of this subjective experience. Interview questions were developed from the literature to determine the perceptions of preparation, barriers, and facilitators in the process, losses, gains, and coping strategies that were helpful. A purposive sample of female nurses from academic institutions and hospitals were invited to participate in one of three focus groups. All were invited to a fourth focus group session during which the findings from the researchers were presented and the participants verified the results. Of the 19 participants, 11 had retired, whereas 8 were in the preretirement phase. Four nurses had accepted an incentive retirement offered at their institution. The conversations were taped, transcribed, and analyzed. Thematic analysis identified both positive and negative aspects of the experience with concerns related to finances, timing of retirement, discretionary time, and relationships. Participants frequently expressed feelings of inadequacy with the numerous decisions related to finances and wished the institution had provided more information. They perceived the most enjoyable gain to be the time to enjoy and do the things they wished. The prevalent feeling among the groups was that the loss of work friends was very difficult. Old relationships would need to be fostered and new ones developed in the retiree role. Based on the findings, support services, including advisers and counselors, are recommended to ease the movement through this transitional process. The assumption is that if individuals have a better understanding of the retirement process and their new role, they will prepare and adjust better. Copyright (C) 1998 by W.B. Saunders Company.

Towards sustainable rural and community development	JOURNAL OF RURAL STUDIES			English	Article							BUSINESS	This paper explores some connections between the 'cultural turn' in recent social theory, and the emergence of new models of local and regional development which have potential importance for the pursuit of sustainable rural development. Two particular examples of attempted cultural engineering, centred on ideas of 'enterprise culture' and of 'corporate culture', are reviewed and both shown to be flawed by their weak conception of culture. A more convincing account of its importance is derived from work on regional development which emphasises the role of social networks and institutional thickness in enabling the growth of confidence and trust as preconditions for success. It is noted that these institutional conditions show some surprising similarities to traditional social features of rural areas, and so help explain the shift from failed strategies of rural development towards more integrated approaches. A number of examples of contemporary development practice in rural Wales are described, to support the suggestion that the attainment of sustainable economic and social development in rural areas depends upon creating social and institutional networks which embed change within the prevailing social and cultural resources of rural populations.

Lower-staff and infrastructure costs enable social model programs to offer more (nonmedical) services and a longer stay at comparatively lower cost. Among the services they provide are vocational rehabilitation and job-search training, with the view that participants are better-off if re-entry is mediated by sober social networks, stable environments, and employment. This paper demonstrates that employment training/job search activities are integrated into social model programs, and offers qualitative evidence of how staff and advanced residents teach the value of work, Longitudinal quantitative data collected at the same time suggest the focus of social model on employment does make a difference in posttreatment functioning: 1-year follow-up Addiction Severity Index (ASI) scores show decreases in employment problems among social model clients, along with comparable improvement on other composite scores of the ASI.

Using bibliometric data on 411 organizations in the field of plant biotechnology, we test several hypotheses that entry is not only influenced by the density of the field, but also by the structure of the R&D network within the community. The empirical findings point to the usefulness of bibliometric data in mapping change and evolution in technological communities, as well as to the effects of networking on entry behavior.

Samples of mixing patterns and network structures derived from randomly sampling individuals are not themselves random samples of measures of partnerships or networks. In addition, the sensitive nature of questions on sexual activity will result in the introduction of non-response biases, which in estimating network structures are likely to be non-ignorable. Adjusting estimates for these biases by using standard statistical approaches is complicated by the complex interactions between the mechanisms generating bias and the non-independent nature of network data. Using a two-step Monte Carlo simulation approach, we have shown that measures of mixing patterns and the network structure that do not account for missing data and non-random sampling are severely biased. Here, we use this approach to adjust raw estimates in data to incorporate these effects, The results suggest that the risk for transmission of STDs in empirical data is underestimated by ignoring missing data and non-random sampling.

In a representative sample of community dwelling and institutionalized adults, aged 70 to 104 gears, Ive explored whether such indication of socioemotional selectivity was related to personality characteristics and family status. Extraversion, Openness to Experience, and Neuroticism as assessed by the NEO-PI were related to overall network size but unrelated to the average emotional closeness of social partners in the network (i.e., our indicator of socioemotional selectivity). Family status, in contrast, was related to average emotional closeness to network members. Moreover, family status moderates the relationship between average emotional closeness to network members and feelings of social embeddedness. Findings suggest a stronger influence of contextual rather than personality factors on social functioning in late life.

Although not that long ago festivals were seen only in terms of their economic impact, they are now considered by some as a tool for promoting changes in local identity. But the issue is not that simple. When a festival is organized, there is no automatic guarantee that it will be repeated and will colour the local identity of a community. A case study of folklore festivals, and particularly the Drummondville International Folklore Festival, was fertile ground for exploring the issue. Organizing a festival means juggling budgetary 'constraints (neg otium) and the abundance of leisure activities and enjoyment offered (otium). Choosing an appropriate site, mobilizing local volunteers and attracting tourists are ingredients that are vital to ensuring a healthy self-financing margin. Economic issues, however, are only one aspect of the problem. The development of a festive atmosphere, the insertion of local residents into new social networks and the feeling of being at the heart of an adventure that goes beyond everyday boundaries have contributed to refreshing the image of the community under investigation.

The main focus is on the large social network assembly, although many other innovations are mentioned. In 1980 there were about ten schools of network practice. Today, there are many more particularly in countries with more advanced social welfare programs than the United States of America. Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Canada, Italy and more recently Finland have assumed leading roles in the practice and development of the Network Therapies.

Three forms of legitimacy - cognitive, moral, and pragmatic - are important in understanding their evolution and social integration. Cognitive legitimacy corresponds to what is usually considered by organizational ecologists to be legitimacy as 'taken-for-grantedness'. Organizations have moral legitimacy in so far as they have the moral approval of most members of society. Pragmatic legitimacy 'rests on the self-interested calculations of an organization's most immediate audiences' (Suchman 1995). The analysis goes beyond previous work in two ways. First, new mechanisms of legitimation are introduced into models of organizational founding and growth. Second, organizations are assumed to be able to deliberately influence their legitimacy by their actions. Empirical tests combine quantitative analyses of founding and growth rates with a qualitative analysis of historical material. In addition to density-dependent processes of legitimation, the organizations are found to act in a social-movement-like manner, thereby enhancing their moral legitimacy. This increases their founding and growth rates, and gives them a competitive advantage over earlier forms of money-lending that lacked moral legitimacy. I also find evidence that pragmatic legitimacy is spread via social networks.

On the basis of a network analysis of the 158 articles on inter-organizational relations and networks that were published in four leading journals from 1980 to 1996, this paper empirically explores the linkages among, and configurations of, core theories and concepts underlying earlier empirical research on inter-organizational relations and networks. We identify core, as well as peripheral, areas of research interest in the field and point out areas of overlap and consolidation. Moreover, our empirical analysis shows that the field segments into four substantive research perspectives, namely social network, power and control, institutional, and institutional economics and strategy clusters. In sum, we suggest an innovative, empirically grounded approach towards a literature review that aims at a synopsis of a field of study and highlights possibly fruitful avenues for future research.

Social capital describes the benefits that are derived from personal social relationships (within families and communities) and social affiliations. This investigation examined the extent to which social capital is associated with positive developmental and behavioral outcomes in high-risk preschool children. Design. A cross-sectional case-control analysis of young children "doing well" and "not doing well" at baseline in four coordinated longitudinal studies. Participants. A total of 667 2- to 5-year-old children (mean age, 4.4 years) and their maternal caregivers who are participating in the Longitudinal Studies of Chile: Abuse and Neglect Consortium. At recruitment, all children were characterized by unfavorable social or economic circumstances that contributed to the identification of the children as high risk. Measures. Social capital was defined as benefits that accrue from social relationships within communities and families. A social capital index was created by assigning one point to each of the following indicators: I) two parents or parent-figures in the home; 2) social support of the maternal caregiver 3) no more than two children in the family; 4) neighborhood support; and 5) regular church attendance. Outcomes were measured with the Child Behavior Checklist, a widely used measure of behavioral/emotional problems, and with the Battelle Developmental Inventory Screening Test; a standardized test that identifies developmental deficits. Children were classified as doing well if their scares on these instruments indicated neither behavioral nor developmental problems. Results. Only 13% of the children were classified as doing well. The individual indicators that best discriminated between levels of child functioning were the most direct measures of social capital-church affiliation, perception of personal social support, and support within the neighborhood. The social capital index was strongly associated with child well-being, more so than any single indicator. The presence of any social capital indicator increased the odds of doing well by 29%; adding any two increased the odds of doing well by 66%. Conclusions. Our findings suggest that social capital may have an impact on children's well-being as early as the preschool years. In these years it seems to be the parents' social capital that confers benefits on their off-spring, just as children benefit from their parents' financial and human capital. Social capital may be most crucial far families who have fewer financial and educational resources. Our findings suggest that those interested in the healthy development of children, particularly children most at risk for poor developmental outcomes, must search for new and creative ways of supporting interpersonal relationships and strengthening the communities in which families carry out the daily activities of their lives.

Social support and the development of postnatal depressive symptoms, a prospective cohort survey	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article							GENERAL HEALTH QUESTIONNAIRE; LIFE EVENTS; THREATENING EXPERIENCES; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER; COMMUNITY; INTERVIEW; PREGNANCY; VALIDITY; NETWORK; STRESS	Background. A prospective epidemiology study evaluated the role of specific social and psychological variables in the prediction of depressive symptomatology and disorders following childbirth in a community sample. Measures of social support used previously in clinically depressed populations facilitated further comparison. Methods. Nulliparous pregnant women (N = 507) were interviewed during pregnancy with the Interview Measure of Social Relationships (IMSR) and a contextual assessment of pregnancy-related support and adversity and 427 were followed up at 3 months postpartum with the 30-item GHQ, including six depression items. To establish the clinical representativeness of the GHQ, high GHQ scorers and a random subsample of low scorers were interviewed using the SCAN. Regression models were developed using the GHQ Depression scale (GHQ-D), the IMSR and other risk factor data. Results. GHQ-D after childbirth was predicted by lack of perceived support from members of the woman's primary group and lack of support in relation to the event becoming pregnant; this held even after controlling for antenatal depression, neuroticism, family and personal psychiatric history and adversity. Informant-rated deficits in provision of social support also predicted later depression. The size of the primary social network group previously found to be related to depression in women, did not predict depressive symptom development. Conclusion. Predictors of depressive symptom development differ from predictors of recovery from clinical depression in women. Interventions should be designed to reduce specific deficits in social support observed in particular study populations.

However, police and researchers eschew victim target networks (VTN). Rather, their attention is overwhelmingly concerned with the offender's characteristics, As an alternative to traditional police investigations, this paper suggests that by directing attention to victim target networks, inferences about the decision-making process underlying the selection of crime locations, victims, and locating offenders' home bases can be made. The paper presents a decision-making model that the serial predator uses to scope out potential victim target networks and shows how proactive policing in victim target areas can deter the killer. The study also posits that by directing investigative attention to victim social networks, police can first identify a set of prospective victims targeted by a serial killer. The study closes with suggestions about the applicability of law enforcement use of victims' targeting networks and how victim social networks can be used to link serial murder victims.

Children's social preferences were identified by analysing relative utterance frequencies which revealed a network structure of 4 cliques. We then examined whether the integration (inclusion/exclusion) and social theme (person/action) content of children's utterances, and the responses (accept/oppose) to these utterances, discriminated relationships in the social network. Our main findings were 1) Exclusive utterances were more likely to occur between nonfriends and to be opposed. Inclusive utterances were more likely to occur between friends and to be accepted. 2) Person and action themes were used differentially. In exclusion statements, nonfriends were more likely to be personally rejected whereas friends were more likely to have their actions rejected. In inclusion statements, personal references were more likely to be accepted between friends whereas references to a peer's actions tended to be accepted by both friends mid nonfriends. We concluded that children adapted the integration and social theme content of their utterances to relationship context in order to establish more intimate interactions between friends and more distant interactions between nonfriends.

We employ a method known as a "network scale-up method". By using a collection of subpopulations of known size, and also asking about one subpopulation (those who are seropositive) of unknown size, we make various estimates of personal network size and the size of the seropositive subpopulation. Our best (maximum Likelihood, unbiased) estimates are 108 members of the network defined by "having been in contact with during the previous two years", and (approximately unbiased) 1.6 million for the seropositive subpopulation. Because of the proportional over-representation of AIDS (and presumably, therefore, seropositive) in Florida, by a factor of about two, this latter estimate could be an overestimate.

The measures are created using a reverse distance (geodesic) matrix thus providing a directed closeness measure. Integration and radiality are then correlated with other centrality measures to examine the differences and similarities between each other and these other centrality measures. We then show how integration and radiality are associated with certain demographic and substantive variables. Integration and radiality provide a new index of network structure and our results show how that structure may influence behavior. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

This paper draws from the Network-Episode Model to systematically consider the different social processes through which people come to enter psychiatric treatment by exploring the "stories" told by individuals making their first major contact with, the mental health system. We combine the use of qualitative and quantitative methods to examine data from the Indianapolis Network Mental Health Study, a longitudinal study of individuals in treatment at the largest public and voluntary facilities in the city. We analyze detailed self-reports of how they came to use mental health services, classifying these stories as "choice," "coercion," or "muddling through." Using multinomial legit analyses, we examine how factors such as gender, race and diagnosis shape the types of stories that individuals tell. The preliminary results indicate that fewer than half of the stories (45.9%) match the notion of choice underlying the dominant utilization theories. Almost a quarter of respondents (22.9%) report coercion and nearly one-third (31.2%) tell stories that lack a clear agent. Diagnosis and social networks tap differences in how individuals experience entry into care. Individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder or who have larger, closer social networks are more likely to tell stories of coercion. We discuss the theoretical; methodological, and clinical implications of findings drawn from this examination of clients' stories (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

Using symbolic interaction theory, this paper examines the contours of post-dating relationships, asking the following questions: 1) how do people orient themselves to one another after a dating relationship ends?; and, 2) what is the power dynamic between one's social network and his or her post-dating relationship? Using a snowball sample (N = 30), interview data are analyzed as narratives about the respondents' construction of post-dating relationships. Until recently, research has focused on postdivorce relationships and has characterized these as maladaptive (Weiss 1975; Spanier and Casto 1979; Berman 1985). This study joins recent research which suggests that relationships between former spouses or lovers may satisfy legitimate needs such as friendship, shared history, and extended social networks (Metts, Cupach and Bejlovec 1989; Aydintug 1995).

Furthermore, unlike the conventional approach that focuses on parent-child relationships in families, the author defined social capital to include social relationships and networks outside the family that parents can use. The relative importance of each component of family capital for a child's education is illustrated by a case study of socialist Czechoslovakia in which social capital was operationalized by membership in the Communist Party. The study found that in addition to each component's independent influences on children's educational attainment, there may also be an. interaction effect between the parents' social and human capital in the conversion process.

Nixon II	SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL			English	Article							SPORT; GENDER; HURT	This paper presents a sociological assessment of Howard L. Nixon II's work on risk, pain, and injury in sport. Nixon employs a variant of social network analysis in order to understand the "culture of risk" which, he claims, constrains athletes to play with pain and injuries. By drawing on aspects of figurational sociology, one might expand Nixon's work and account for the broader social processes connected to the development of modern sport and, concurrently, the networks of relationships in which athletes are bound up. His notion of the "sportsnet" is examined, and further research is recommended to enable an understanding of how socially appropriate modes of behavior in sport come to be embedded at subconscious levels for all members of the sportsnet.

Unfortunately, there is also evidence that civil society is declining, squeezed by both the market and the state. Because sports and exercise are often focal points for civic engagement, these activities have the potential to become important sites its revitalization. Therefore, a crucial task is the preparation of future physical activity professionals to become change agents who recognize the need for enhancing civil society and are familiar with strategies to help bring this about. Sport sociologists should take the lead in shaping this component of professional preparation.

Study participants included 21 African-American, 39 Anglo-American, and 3 Mexican-American women in continuous recovery for a minimum of 6 months. Study findings demonstrated statistically significant increases in social network size and in the amount of social support received from pretreatment to posttreatment recovery periods. Ethnicity, age, and primary drug had little effect on social network size and amount of social support received.

Two theoretical areas that have shown some success in predicting behavior change among of out-of-treatment drug users are Bandura's social cognitive theory (self-efficacy theory) and social network theory. According to Bandura, social networks are important sources of social support, and social support is vital to self-efficacy. Social network research also indicates that close bonds with network members may be a protective factor independently of self-efficacy. In order to test the feasibility of collecting such data, a pilot study was conducted with 60 women who used crack cocaine and who were not in treatment. Results of Pearson product-moment correlations indicated that self-efficacy (.7230) and number of very strong ties (.31252994) were positively correlated with condom use for women in the sample. In addition, the number of very strong ties (.3142) was significantly, if modestly, correlated with self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was also associated with behavioral performance in multivariate regression analysis, whose number of very strong ties had a moderate, though not significant, effect on self-efficacy. The author recommends that social network assessment be adopted in larger studies as a part of HIV risk assessment.

Adolescents with high depression scores in self-evaluation (12.3%) or reporting previous suicide attempts (2.4%) were diagnostically interviewed together with one control for each, matched for gender and educational program. After the interview self-ratings were completed regarding social network, family climate, and life events. Major depression was prevalent during the last year in 5.8% and during life time in 11.4%, 4 girls for every boy. A depression with remaining symptoms for a year or more was the most common type. Dysthymia without major depressive episodes was diagnosed in 1.1%, two girls for every boy. Short hypomanic episodes had been experienced by 13.2% of those with major depressive disorder. Anxiety disorder was comorbid to depression in one half and conduct disorder in one forth of the depressed adolescents. Alcohol was abused by 6.5% and used regularly by another 12%. Other drugs were used by 6.5% of depressed adolescents and not at all by controls. The depressed used tobacco twice as frequently as non-depressed. Social network and family climate were compared within the originally matched pairs. Adolescents with long-lasting depressions had a smaller and unsatisfying social network. They also had experienced many stressful life events related to family adversities, while those with shorter depressive episodes had stress related to the peer group. Depressed adolescents with comorbid conduct disorder reported insufficient support from the close network and a more negative family climate.

Subsequently, the children's social development in kindergarten was observed longitudinally over a two-year period. Cross-sectionally, attachment and inhibition were independent of each other, and inhibition was negatively correlated with social network size. Regarding the quality of network relationships, a domain specificity of attachment and inhibition was observed: Whereas frequency of conflict in family relations was significantly correlated with attachment and independent of inhibition, frequency of conflict in relationships outside the family was significantly related to inhibition but independent of attachment. Longitudinally, attachment and inhibition independently predicted shy behavior in the peter group in the first year of preschool; in the second year, only inhibition was predictive. Other aspects of children's peer group behavior were unrelated to inhibition and attachment. These findings highlight the high domain specificity of both inhibition and attachment.

In general, pessimistic or limited future orientations were shown to be associated with feelings of loneliness. However, this association disappeared when older people had a large percentage of very close emotional relationships in their social network. Findings suggest that older people who experienced their future as limited or negative? had a higher risk of experiencing loneliness. This risk seemed to be reduced when older people reported more emotional meaningful social experiences than other social contacts.

Results from 250 students indicated that centrality in friendship, communication, and adversarial networks affected both student attitudes and grades. Moreover, an analysis of 62 assigned teams showed that relationships within and between teams also had significant effects on student perceptions of team effectiveness and objective team performance. Implications for student networks and suggestions for future research are discussed.

The psychiatric teams responsible for the treatment of the patients conducted detailed standardized interviews with the patients at entry and at the end of the first, second and fifth years. Changes in patients' clinical and functional outcome were analysed according to their living situation and social network. Positive changes in clinical slate and functional ability were most prominent among patients who were living with their spouse. The social and functional outcome of men living with their parents was better than that of women in the same situation, while among patients Living alone or with some other person the gender difference was reversed. Family environment can be of great importance to schizophrenic patients, supporting their clinical and functional recovery from psychosis. Patients Living outside families - and men in particular - are at great risk of poor outcome, perhaps because they often lose their social contacts. In the treatment of such individuals a more active strategy of out-patient and rehabilitative care is therefore needed.

Subjects were randomly recruited from five legally authorized syringe exchange programs in New York City between October 1992 and August 1994. Participants were asked about drug and sexual risk behavior 30 days prior to their first use of the syringe exchange as well as during the 30-day period prior to the interview while using the exchange. Of the 2,465 participants, 77.4% reported no risky injection during the 30 days prior to using syringes exchange. :For this analysis we included only those who reported risky injection for the 30-day period prior to using syringe exchange (N = 556). We compared sociodemographics and behavioral characteristics of a group who continued risky injection while using the syringe exchange, "continuers," N = 158 (28.8%) with a group who reported risky injection prior to using the exchange and then ceased risky injection while using the exchange, "stoppers," N = 391 (71.2%). Continuers were significantly more likely to report passing on dirty syringes to social network members and to inject cocaine at least daily. We present other predictors of continued risk and discuss the implications for interventions and make recommendations for syringe exchange programs.

This claim has not, however, been subject to empirical investigation. This article reports on an empirical investigation of maternal depression and factors associated with it in child and family care social work. This showed that nearly two fifths of mothers in this client group suffered depression and a further 30 per cent were dysphoric. Families with depressed mothers suffered a greater number, range and severity of problems and were more likely to be categorized as more serious cases by the social services department. Depressed women more frequently had poorer social networks, problems with relatives and friends, displayed more problems with parenting and had children with more behavioural difficulties. Despite this, however, social workers were very poor al identifying the presence of depression and their intervention did not differ in any marked respect compared with families without depressed mothers. The article concludes that the philosophy of the Children Act 1989 and an anti-oppressive stance indicates that child-care social workers should be able to understand and work with this widespread depression.

Specifically, a department's experience is reviewed in light of transaction cost and social network theories-two perspectives that have explanatory potential for temporary employment systems. The juxtaposition of a temporary, private employment system with a permanent, government labor regime produced significant strains and contrasts and important benefits. Particularly interesting was the use of temporary management in addition to temporary direct labor in the restructuring. Management's effort to cope with the challenges of restructuring, present interview findings, and quantitative data based on questionnaire responses of 99 temporary and permanent employees concerning their satisfaction, job and work involvement, and interdependence are reviewed. Transaction cost and social network theories complement one another in interpreting questionnaire and interview findings to understand temporary employment systems.

People at the local level are increasingly being drawn into larger circuits through economic linkages, demographic processes, social interactions, and flows of information that transcend local and national boundaries. Such global linkages and the new embeddedness they produce require more sophisticated approaches to ethnography. This paper proposes social network analysis as a valuable approach to that end. The concept of embeddedness, which is central to the social networks perspective, is introduced. Hierarchical embeddedness of the local level in the larger society, economy, and polity is distinguished from domain embeddedness, the interpenetration of different fields of activity. Network studies of two ethnographic cases, gift giving among !Kung and ritual celebrations in a Javanese village, illustrate the potential of social network analysis for investigating embeddedness. The paper concludes with substantive and methodological suggestions for the study of embeddedness.		Schweizer, T (reprint author), UNIV COLOGNE, ALBERTUS MAGNUS PL, D-50923 COLOGNE, GERMANY.

Forty children were receiving special education services for learning problems, 66 were in general education. Results showed that children with and without learning problems did not differ on the size or composition of their social networks nor on the negative features of their friendships (conflict, competition). However, children with learning problems used their network differently for support. They turned to the family less for problem-solving support and to peers less for all types of support than children without learning problems. Results are discussed in terms of the implications for children with learning problems as they enter adolescence.

Informants convey information ("data") to anthropologists in a variety of forms. I would claim that such transfers of information are managed by informants in ways that they perceive as to their benefit. Here I compare the ways in which informants in two cultures, Japanese townspeople and Ethiopian immigrants in Israel, manage their relations with an anthropologist and manage the sorts of information he receives as well. Control of information is maintained through selective approaches to the ethnographer, monitoring his activities via social networks in which he is peripherally embedded, prevarication, procrastination, and rewards for perceived "proper" behaviors. I suggest that both the anthropologist and his informants operate with a dearth of information about one another, and that the sorts of information that are passed are expressive in the different cultures. The results of the fieldwork enterprise must be viewed therefore as a composite between the two information sets.

One solution to their isolation and vulnerability is to construct networks of mutual support. Under certain conditions, those networks may develop into what is called "families we choose" or social families. The question facing today's designers and housing-planners is how to create the sorts of physical spaces that facilitate patterns of "helping out," i.e., network-friendly housing. Many U.S. public housing units are renovated each year. Simultaneously, many self-help groups are organized among public housing residents. This paper argues that coalescing these two realities is in the best interests of those citizens. Public policies are redefined to facilitate the generation and maintenance of social families. Those families are assisted in designing their own cohousing using a state-of-the-art technique for the collaborative design.

Social support was conceptualized as a coping resource or source of assistance in coping with the renal illness-or hemodialysis-related stressor. The Ways of Coping questionnaire and the Interpersonal Relationship Inventory were administered to 30 participants while in hospital. Although, both problem-focused and emotion-focused forms of coping were used, participants primarily used problem-focused coping, in particular, "seeking social support". Overall, the participants perceived relatively high levels of support and moderate to high levels of reciprocity with members of their social networks. Participants experienced a moderate level of conflict in their interpersonal relationships. Both escape-avoidance and conflict were positively associated with the number of people in the household. Positive reappraisal was negatively associated with the number of close relatives. The small sample size prohibits generalizability of the results. Longitudinal studies with a larger randomly selected sample would yield insights into the long-term psychological outcomes of different coping strategies and into the bi-directional relationship of support from social network and coping in this population. Implications for nurses are discussed. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

A socio-ecological perspective was used to determine whether social support and perceived conflict operate as risk or protective factors. Three samples of adolescents were studied: 63 adolescents in residential care; 29 in day treatment; and 63 who had had no contact with professional care. interrelations were explored by means of structural equation modelling. Social support in family and peer group may operate as a risk factor or a protective factor depending on other risk factors in these subsystems. Perceived conflict is related to behaviour problems, although the influence differs depending on environmental risk factors and the type of behaviour problems.

The value of similar others in the networks of recent widows	JOURNAL OF SOCIAL AND PERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS			English	Article						changes in personal relationships; social networks; social support; stressful life events; widowhood	SOCIAL NETWORKS; LONELINESS; SUPPORT	Contacts with other widows are often seen as having particular value for those who are coping with bereavement. Both the benefits of associating with other widows and the difficulties of maintaining ties with married friends make it likely that recent widows' friendship networks will show increasing 'homophily', based on substituting widowed friends for married friends. We investigated these issues based on a year of longitudinal interviewing with 321 recently widowed women, aged 59-85 years, who provided data about their social support networks, Our results indicate that these widows did shift their networks toward greater association with others who had experienced this life event. We did not, however, find evidence that this was due to the amount or quality of the support they received from widowed rather than married friends. One possible explanation is that widows' preference for associating with their similar others has more to do with the nature of the companionship they share in such relationships, rather than with the provision of social support.

The considerable attention given by studies of discourse style to gender differences in friendship patterns is not reflected in research on bilingual communities. This ethnographic case study of high school students in the Barcelona area shows that gender differences in peer group structure can affect the use of the bilingual repertoire, even when there are no apparent sex differences in second language acquisition. In this setting, girls' friendship circles are more solidary and cohesive than boys'. Moreover, girls' groups are ethnically and linguistically homogeneous, while boys' social circles can be ethnically mixed and internally differentiated linguistically. Girls' friendships set stronger constraints on language behavior. In turn, boys and girls reap different social benefits and costs for their linguistic choices, with more serious consequences for girls' social identities and acceptance by peers.

The strongest predictor of depression was the parent's perception of time resources, which was influenced by the amount of care the child required, the adequacy of money, and baby sitting resources.

This study demonstrated an overall reliability with kappa coefficients between 0.70 and 0.47, but the reliability was more varying among females and lower in the youngest age group. The analysis of the construct validity indicated that the different indices measure different aspects of the psychosocial environment, but both theoretical and methodological problems were identified, when the validity of multidimensional concepts are to be determined. The validity of such indices can best be judged by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. Potential validity problems must be kept in mind when these indices are used in epidemiological research. The results from the reliability analysis call for repeated assessments and the sample size must be adjusted vis-a-vis the reliability.

The study is based on a one-gear cohort of nulliparas followed during pregnancy. From a total of 994 invited women 872 (87.7%) agreed to participate in the study. All women who reported any alcohol consumption within the twelve months prior to the administration of the questionnaire were included in this study population (n=692, 79.4%). 32.8% of the alcohol consumers continued to drink during pregnancy even though the alcohol intake was moderate. In spite of the official Swedish alcohol recommendation for total abstinence during pregnancy, more socially active, and more highly educated women continued drinking alcohol, with wine being the beverage of choice, maybe more as social behavior rather than to cope with stress caused by insufficient psychosocial resources. Younger women or those with fewer years of education tended to stop drinking to a higher degree, but those who continued to drink tended to drink beer or to binge.

We assessed a community-level intervention to lower the risk of HIV infection, focusing on men patronising gay bars in eight small US cities. Methods We used a randomised community-level field design. Four cities received the intervention and four control cities did not. Participants were men from each city who went to gay bars. Men completed surveys about their sexual behaviour on entering the bars during 3-night periods at baseline and a 1-year follow-up. In the control cities, HIV educational materials were placed in the bars. In the intervention cities, we recruited popular homosexual men in the community and trained them to spread behaviour-change endorsements and recommendations to their peers through conversation. Findings Population-level rates of risk behaviour decreased significantly in the intervention cities compared with the control cities at 1-year follow-up, after exclusion of surveys completed by transients and men with exclusive sexual partners. In a city-level analysis, in the intervention cities we found a reduction in the mean frequency of unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 2 months (baseline 1.68 occasions: follow-up 0.59; p=0.04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44.7%; follow-up 66.8%, p=0.02). Increased numbers of condoms taken from dispensers in intervention-city bars corroborated risk-behaviour self-reports. Interpretation Popular and well-liked members of a community who systematically endorse and recommend risk-reduction behaviour can influence the sexual-risk practices of others in their social networks.

A conceptual clarification of the domain of social relationships defines three aspects of social relationships (structure, function and quality), which have both alcohol-specific and general components. We analyse the correlations among post-treatment indicators of social relationships and the associations between these interpersonal variables and post-treatment drinking and subjective wellbeing. Design. This is a secondary analysis of data from an alcohol treatment outcome study, in which subjects were randomly assigned to one of three treatment conditions and followed for 18 months. Setting. The outpatient treatment program is located within a private psychiatric hospital tit the north-eastern United States. Participants. We analyzed the 140 subjects who completed a social network instrument 12 months following treatment assignment. Intervention. This secondary analysis combined clients from three treatment conditions, all of which were based upon social learning theory. Measurements. Interview and questionnaire self-report data were collected by trained interviewers. Findings. Indicators of social relationships are found to be relatively independent of one another. Only alcohol-specific social relationship indicators are significantly associated with drinking outcomes, and only general indicators are significantly associated with subjective wellbeing. Functional indicators, addressing social interaction content, have stronger effects on outcomes than structural or quality indicators. General and alcohol-specific support from friends have more influence than support from family; both surpass the influence of co-workers. Conclusions. A better understanding of the roles of social relationships during the course of treatment and recovery or relapse may help clarify how treatment personnel cart utilize clients' interpersonal relationships more effectively to maximize treatment effectiveness.

Recent research suggests a possible additive effect on selected outcomes when the two approaches are integrated. This paper reviews the role of family support and intervention in the care of persons with serious mental illnesses, presents the research literature on psychoeducation, and highlights benefits of merging the multiple-family version of this approach into the work of assertive community treatment programs.

This paper presents a typology of support networks found amongst older people living in the community. The distinguishing features of five different types of networks are described and a risk profile for each network type is presented. It is shown that different networks have different strengths and weaknesses and that the nature of potential risks is related to the type of support network. Further, the paper addresses the significance of the identification of support network for practice, decision making and intervention with particular reference to: social isolation, hospital discharge, admissions to residential care and mental illness.

In this study, these interrelationships were examined, with special attention given to the gender differences, concerning structures and functions of the social network. Fifty-eight elderly individuals reported life-history evaluations according to the psychosocial conflicts, proposed by Erik H. Erikson. They also reported social network patterns and SOC according to standardized questionnaires. Factor analyses revealed that there are gender differences concerning the patterns of social network. For women, social anchorage was an important factor, while for men, social influence was more important. Structures and functions of the social network correlated with both positive and negative life history evaluations, but the correlations differed between the sexes. When SOC was controlled the correlations changed, but to a small degree. Stepwise discriminant analyses showed that the male social network patterns were predicted from negative evaluations of the identity period, low scores on the sense of manageability, positive evaluations of the trust/autonomy period and high scores on the sense of comprehensibility. The female social network patterns were predicted from negative evaluations of the trust/autonomy and from the late generativity periods and positive evaluations of the early generativity period. It was hypothesized that structures and functions of the social network are sometimes used as compensation for shortcomings in the internal-based self-concept.

AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EDUCATION			English	Article						computer assisted teaching; professional development; teacher role; computer uses in education; social networks; technological literacy		HOW teachers understand their relationship with computer technology is an important element in how they exercise control over their work and hence for their professionalism. Current restructurings in education are reliant upon redefining the work of teachers and ensuring particular roles for the new information and communication technologies. Actor-network theory offers an alternative to the social or technological deterministic understandings to be found in many schools. It emphasises the shaping roles played by both humans and non-humans in the implementation of a technology. This radical approach offers important opportunities for teachers to renegotiate the work they do and the work they delegate to machines.

In-depth interviews were conducted with eight men aged between 73 and 86 years. One prevalent assumption in the literature is that a wife dies men's social networks disintegrated because of their lack of social skills. Contrary to this assumption, the men in this study not only maintained friendships but also instigated new ones. The success of retaining and maintaining old friendships and making new friends, was intrinsic to the men's adaptation to widowhood and thus to successful ageing.

Little is known about the first cohorts of long-stay hospital residents with learning disabilities who moved to the community. This study describes the pattern of residential reprovision for all former long-stay residents discharged from the three mental handicap hospitals in Northern Ireland between 1987 and 1990 (N = 283) as well as describing aspects of quality of life for a smaller sample of people. Method. The study employs a retrospective survey design and the method and findings are discussed within a quality of life framework. Information about destinational outcomes between 1987 and 1993 was collected for each former resident. Several instruments were also used to assess material, emotional and. social wellbeing and development and activity for a 40 per cent sample of people (114/283) discharged from hospital during 1987-1990 and followed up in 1993. Results. Approximately 70 per cent of residents were discharged to, and subsequently remained in, highly supported settings such as residential and nursing homes. Only 3 per cent were discharged to 'independent living' with their own families or foster families. Few of the sample had 'major' problems with daily living skills and serious behavioural problems were uncommon. Former patients were also more satisfied with their new homes and reported feeling happier, healthier and more independent since discharge. However, social networks were poor and there was no evidence to suggest that people were undertaking new or 'ordinary' daytime activities. Conclusion, Although the material needs of former hospital residents (many of whom may have been 'cream skimmed' from the long-stay population) appeared to be met and they were content with their new homes in the community, they had a limited choice of mainly private sector accommodation and few opportunities for personal and social development.

All striking production employees at this facility were surveyed and network analysis techniques were employed to provide both graphical and quantitative demonstrations of the communication structure among the employees. The communication structure illustrates employees who were gatekeepers and brokers of strike-related communications. This information was subsequently used by the organization to redirect its management-labor communication strategy, with the direct result being an end to the work stoppage. Implications are drawn for management to increase its understanding of communication structures for the purpose of better utilizing its human capital.

The objective of this study was to examine service utilization figures among a representative sample of demented patients and to determine whether sociodemographic and health-related variables are associated with care utilization Method. The study population was derived from a population-based, two-stage cross-sectional study in The Netherlands and consisted of 102 demented subjects. Four levels of care intensity were used: level I, no use of professional care; level 2, use of one or more types of professional care by community-dwelling subjects; level 3, residential living in homes for the aged; level 4, long-term care in specialized nursing homes. Sociodemographic variables and variables related to mental and physical health, functional dependency and severity of dementia were studied as determinants of levels of care. Results. Eighty-two per cent of the study subjects used one or more types of formal care and 55% were institutionalized. Multivariate analysis yielded age, severity of dementia, somatic disorders, dependency in terms of ADL and martial status as predictors of higher levels of care. Sets of predictors differed across different care levels. Conclusions. The findings point to the importance of the social network and the relevance of general medical treatment and an active approach towards decreasing the impact of ADL dependency in demented subjects.

This was a telephone survey of 3719 individuals from a representative sample of the population aged between 15 and 59. The models of sexuality within couples theme provide the basis for exploring three aspects of partners' sociability and the normative influence of their social networks: the relationship between the ideal norms of the actors and the actual norms in the network comprising the circles of family, friends and colleagues; the links between the norms of the actors and their subjective perception of the social control exercised by the various circles of sociability; the structural end relational characteristics of the network, in particular of the circle of friends, likely to influence this relationship. The analyses show the normative influence of the network, and especially of the family circle, on the norms of ego. They also show that this normative influence is likely to be conditioned by the subjective perception of social control, as well as by certain structural characteristics of the network.

The patterns of behaviour reflected in the coauthorship networks of the invisible colleges of physics, resemble the general structure of relations identified in social networks beyond the communities of scholars. The patterns of behaviour are portrayed both as two-dimensional and three-dimensional models.		Kretschmer, H (reprint author), Borgsdorfer Str 5, D-16540 Hohen Neuendorf, Germany.

Using a social network analysis approach, team members were classified as occupying the same structural position based on their patterns of relationships with other team members. The analysis was based on the results of a self-administered survey of 93 health care workers on three teams in the same multilevel geriatric care facility in Metropolitan Toronto. A common structure of the teams was identified consisting of two sub-teams: a multiprofessional sub-team and a nursing sub-team, each of which has a different structure indicating differential involvement in different types of teamwork. The multiprofessional sub-team has an ''organic'' structure and is mainly involved in teamwork that involves decision-making and problem-solving, whereas the nursing sub-team has a ''mechanistic'' structure and is mainly involved in task oriented work. The findings of this analysis indicate that while teamwork may be increasing the participation in decision-making by health professionals other than medicine, rather than flattening the hierarchical structure throughout the health care division of labour, its effects are limited to a group of higher status professionals. The clearly defined hierarchy remains for the lower status subdisciplines, and ''I decide, you carry it out'' has simply become ''We decide, you carry it out''. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Consequences of different life styles for fathers after divorce on the social network and health in comparison with married fathers	SYSTEM FAMILIE			German	Article							POSTDIVORCE; INVOLVEMENT; ADJUSTMENT	In this study the situation of divorced fathers with different life styles is analyzed with respect to social support, social stress, the kind of fathering and health in comparison to the situation of married fathers. For this purpose, a sample of 357 divorced fathers without custody and 131 married fathers was selected by the courts of Zurich and Winterthur and interviewed. According to the interviews, divorced fathers even several years after the divorce suffer more from physical and psychological troubles than married fathers. Different life styles after the divorce have both a direct and indirect influence via secondary networks on coping with social strain. A new partnership often goes hand in hand with an extended social network and contributes to subjective well-being and satisfaction with the situation. The social stress of divorced fathers living with a new partner is similar to that of the other categories of divorced fathers, but the social support they receive is higher and corresponds more to that of married fathers. The frequency of physical troubles is reduced by the existence of a new partnership and the social support related to it. Assessing the quality of their relationship with the child, divorced fathers are more positive than married fathers. Divorced fathers can also better imagine having custody on their own.

To explore this discrepancy, the authors interviewed a sample of 51 employers about the information they use in hiring entry-level workers. They found that employers have much available information but mistrust information from mast sources. This mistrust explains their strong emphasis on impressions in interviews, a method that has been shown to give invalid (and biased) results, which often results in their selecting unproductive workers. The authors also found that some employers overcome the problem of mistrusted information in two ways: using information from their own workers and from long-term social networks. Although economic theory assumes that labor markets respond to all sources of information, these results suggest that employers use only information received in a social context that ensures its trustworthiness.

Thus far, most researchers have concentrated on dyadic relationships between individual stakeholders and a: focal organization. Using social network analysis, I construct in this article a theory of stakeholder influences, which accommodates multiple, interdependent stakeholder demands and predicts how organizations respond to the simultaneous influence of multiple stakeholders.

This governance form has received significant scholarly attention but, to date, no comprehensive theory for it has been advanced, and no sufficiently detailed and theoretically consistent definition hers appeared. Our objective in this article is to provide a theory that explains under what conditions network governance, rigorously defined, has comparative advantage and is therefore likely to emerge and thrive. Our theory integrates transaction cost economics and social network theories, and. in brood strokes, asserts that the network form of governance is a response to exchange conditions of asset specificity, demand uncertainty, task complexity, and frequency. These exchange conditions drive firms toward structurally embedding their transactions, which enables firms to use social mechanisms for coordinating and safeguarding exchanges. When all of these conditions are in pierce, the network governance form has advantages over both hierarchy and market solutions in simultaneously adapting, coordinating, and safeguarding exchanges.

Consistent with prior research, we find that an. individual's mobility is enhanced by having a large, sparse network of informal ties for acquiring information and resources. However in contrast to previous work, we emphasize the importance of consistent role expectations for performance and mobility. We find evidence that well-defined performance expectations are more likely to arise from a small, dense network of individuals. We develop a typology of network contents and document the interaction between network structure and content in analyses of mobility among employees of a high-technology firm. We also examine how the effects of tie duration on mobility vary by tie content. We discuss the implications of our results for theory and research on networks and organizational mobility.

This article describes the development of a new practical method for mapping the structural elements and understanding the content of interdisciplinary collaboration in a center designed specifically to support this kind of activity. How to study who collaborates with wham and the settings in which these activities take place are explored. Information is provided to assist others in conducting similar research to document the structural nature of their collaboration. The Educational Centre for Aging and Health (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) described in this article was very successful in fostering interdisciplinary activities, and the contextual characteristics that promote this success are identified.

A study was commissioned by the Departments of Health for England, Scotland and Wales, to explore the extent and uses of AS from the public health point of view. As a part of a wider investigation into AS use, 21 gymnasia in England, Scotland and Wales were surveyed by questionnaire. The response rate was 59%. We found that of the 1667 participants, 9.1% of the men and 2.3% of the women had taken AS at some time and 6% of the men and 1.4% of the women were current users. Considerable variation in the prevalence of use was found, ranging from no reports in three of the gymnasia, up to 46%. We also investigated patterns of AS use and perceived side-effects in a wide-ranging group of AS users (n = 110), who were recruited through social networks. in-depth interviews with the users revealed that the 97 men (27+/-7 years) and 13 women (25+/-5 years) had been using AS regularly for 2.05+/-1.7 years and 1.9+/-2 years, respectively. Seventy-two injected AS. While most injected themselves, 25% were mainly injected by their friend. Up to 16 different drugs were taken by interviewees during the present or last cycle. Polydrug use was common and dosage taken exceeded therapeutic recommendations. Sixteen interviewees did not report side-effects, while the majority reported two or more. Many of these were cosmetic. Of the 97 men interviewed, 56% reported testicular atrophy, 52% gynaecomastia, 36% elevated blood pressure, 56% fluid retention, 26% injuries to tendons, 22% nosebleeds and 16% more frequent colds. Six men reported problems with kidney function and five with liver function. Problems with sleep were reported by 37%. Of the 13 women interviewed, eight reported menstrual irregularities, eight fluid retention, four clitoral enlargement, three decreased breast size and two elevated blood pressure. Four reported sleeplessness.	CTR RES DRUGS & HLTH BEHAV,LONDON SW6 1RQ,ENGLAND	Korkia, P (reprint author), UNIV LUTON,DEPT EXERCISE & SPORT SCI,PK SQ,LUTON LU1 3JU,BEDS,ENGLAND.

Yet, among not-in-treatment injection drug users, the chances of becoming infected with HIV vary substantially. Information regarding the factors that facilitate the introduction of HIV into networks of drug injectors in low HIV seroprevalence cities is urgently needed. This study examines the factors related to HIV seroprevalence in a large (n=9492), multi-site sample of IDUs recruited in 11 low seroprevalence cities. Univariate and multivariate associations between drug injection and sexual behaviours and travel to an AIDS epicentre were examined. Results show that, next to male-to-male sexual contact, having sex at least twice in an AIDS epicentre was the strongest predictor of HIV infection. Also associated with higher odds of being HIV-positive were racial/ethnic characteristics, daily drug injection, and injecting drugs in an AIDS epicentre. These results confirm that travelling to an AIDS epicentre and having sex or injecting drugs play a large role in the introduction of HIV into drug injector networks in low seroprevalence cities.

Coping strategies were related to distress levels only 1 year later. Multiple regression analysis of change in anxiety and depressed mood revealed that a decrease of psychological distress after 1 year could be predicted by male sex, an initially less severe inflammatory activity and an initially more extended social network. In addition, a decrease in distress was related to parallel improvements in clinical status. Results indicate the importance of a multimodal assessment of demographic variables, clinical and life stressors and social resources for the understanding of distress and the identification of risk factors in the first stage of the disease.

Multiple components were used to assess attachment bonds: using the attachment figure as a safe haven in times of distress, using him or her as a secure base from which to venture out independently, having a strong emotional tie with the person regardless of whether the tie is positive, negative, or mixed, seeking to be in close proximity to the person, and mourning the loss of the person. The Attachment Network Questionnaire (ANO) was developed to measure multiple adult attachment relationships and to examine the characteristics of attachment hierarchies. 223 university students completed the ANQ by listing their significant relationships and then ranking these persons in terms of the various components of attachment. A subset of the participants was followed up to examine the one month test-retest reliability of the ANQ. Young adult participants were found, on average, to have 5.38 attachment figures, including family members, romantic partners, and friends. The figures identified included both secure and insecure attachments. In addition, the ANQ demonstrated adequate test-retest reliability over one month.

By contrast, the present study takes a dialectical perspective, arguing that loyalty is a social experience in which relationship parties face a cross-current of competing and oppositional loyalty demands. As a consequence, when parties are loyal to one relational expectation they simultaneously are likely to be disloyal to another expectation. Two-hundred and seventy-three informants provided accounts of everyday competing loyalties of two kinds for a friendship and for a romantic relationship: external competing loyalties in which one faces a dilemma between the relationship and some other demand outside the boundary of the dyad; and internal competing loyalties in which one faces a dilemma between one relational expectation and another within the boundary of the dyad. We analyzed the 1092 accounts using the constant comparative method, resulting in nine kinds of external competing loyalty dilemmas and six kinds of internal competing loyalty dilemmas. In addition, findings address how relationship parties managed the dilemmas.		Baxter, LA (reprint author), UNIV IOWA, 105 BCSB, IOWA CITY, IA 52242 USA.

An unselected community cohort of Vietnamese boat refugees was personally interviewed, first on arrival in Norway (n = 145) and again after 3 years (ri = 130). By the time of the second interview:: the refugees had to a large degree reconstructed social networks and 54% had good contact with other Vietnamese. Only 17% had equally good contact with Norwegians. Female gender, further education after resettlement and having a close confidant on arrival were related to good inter-ethnic social contact. The latter was the only predictor of good intra-ethnic social contact. Competency in the Norwegian language, surprisingly, did not predict good social contact with Norwegians. The refugees were largely successful in re-establishing a social platform in relation to their own ethnic group in their new environment. It was much more difficult to establish good social contact with Norwegians. Educational institutions appear to be important social arenas in this respect. The personal capacity for close attachments during a period of psychosocial transition is also important.

The self-employment pattern of ethnic minority business, particularly the success of Asian-immigrant small business, is currently explained by two different hypotheses: the social resources explanation and the class resources explanation. While the former approach attributes the large number of small business enterprises and their success to the existence of such social resources as rotating credit associations, a protected market, and a labor source within Asian American communities, the latter argues that success instead is caused by greater investment of human and financial capital by these immigrants. The present study compares the self-employment pattern of the restaurant industry operated by African Americans and immigrant Chinese in Denver. Contrasts and similarities in ownership characteristics, start-up capital, location, social networks, and economic significance prompted this study to conclude that alone neither explanation is satisfactory and more empirical studies are needed.

There was no support for hypotheses that charitable contributions had decreased, became more tightly coupled to market position, or were less influenced by chief executive officers' social networks. In neither period did the percent of sales to consumers affect contributions; labor intensities had a weak negative effect in 1979-81 and a strong negative effect in 1987-89; and in both periods social network ties to local philanthropic leaders, company performance, and size were positively related to giving, while CEO ownership had a negative effect. Only when firms came under the control of a large outside investor was the effect of network position on contributions significantly weakened.

Method During a 2.5-year period, 47 long-term mentally iii persons were examined at the time of entry to a group home programme. Residents' psychopathology, social integration, mastery and quality of life were measured by structured interviews, including the Present State Examination (PSE-10); and their social functioning was recorded by interview with the staff: Forty-four of the residents were re-examined at follow-up after a mean of 1.1 years using the same instruments. Data on hospitalisation were obtained through the Danish Psychiatric Case Register. Results Eighty-three per cent of the residents remained in the programme during the first year. They showed a significant improvement in subjective quality of I iie, PSE total score, social integration, functioning and hospitalisation index. The number of reciprocal supportive contacts in the social network increased. Lower baseline PSE total score was associated with adherence to the programme, and the improvement in quality of life during their stay was predicted by reduction in symptoms and improvement in social integration. Conclusions A rehabilitation strategy of supplementing standard psychiatric treatment with a programme of small supportive group homes improves the quality of life, psychosocial functioning and community tenure of the long-term mentally ill.

This perspective further suggests that a 'code' is created using behaviors and correlated sequences of behaviors to overcome the noise generated by the oppressive externalities and consequent internal feedbacks causing community disorganization. The often-observed and highly destructive clustering of violence, substance abuse, and unsafe sexual activity appears as a consequence of a fundamental canonical mechanism (described by the Shannon-McMillan theorem) which favors intercorrelated meaningful sequences of behavioral or other signals to maximize the rate of transmission of information under noisy conditions. Such intercorrelation, in addition to accelerating the spread of infection carried by risk behaviors within marginalized communities, may cause their fragmented networks to become highly efficient compound channels, acting as bridges for the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other pathogens or behavioral pathologies from inner core groups to embedding majority populations. Individually oriented prevention programs addressing risk behaviors in ghettoized populations will thus have limited impact-particularly as strategies for the containment of infection-without a parallel address of the external marginalizing stressors which structure and enhance the value of such behaviors as useful symbols for communication. Without the introduction of new, politically based behaviors as alternative symbols within 'core group' communities, control of HIV and other pathogens seems unlikely in the United States.

We evaluated the association between change in social ties (assessed in 1982 and 1985) and subsequent mortality through 1993 in a population-based cohort of 2,575 rural persons ages 65-102 years. The same summary measure of social ties was constructed for both interviews and included marital status, number of close friends and relatives, church attendance, and membership in a group. Compared with persons reporting higher levels of social ties at both interviews, a decrease to a low level of social ties was associated with an increased mortality risk for both men [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-2.7] and women (HR = 2.1; 95% CI = 1.5-3.0). Lower levels of social ties at both interviews were also associated with greater mortality risk in men (HR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.5-3.1) and women (HR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.6-2.9), whereas an increase to a higher level of social ties was not associated with subsequent mortality risk. Adjustment for age, education, smoking status, cognitive function, onset of a major illness, change in physical function, change in self-perceived health status, and change in depressive symptoms eliminated the association between loss of social ties and survival, but. both men (HR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.5-3.5) and women (HR = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.2-2.6) reporting low levels of social ties at both interviews remained at elevated risk. The lack of an association between loss of social ties and mortality risk after adjusting for demographic, health, and functional status variables indicates that these are either confounding or intervening variables in a social ties and mortality association. In contrast, sustained low levels of social ties appear to influence mortality risk independent of these same variables and imply that continued social isolation may be a more important determinant of mortality risk than recent changes in social ties.

Girls showed more affective association and looked for help more readily than boys. Children with poor academic performance had difficulties in forming social relationships were less sensitive of the social consequences of their behavior and enjoyed less support from friends, their immediate family and even animals. Results in general were most unfavorable for economically disadvantaged boys. Various strategies to counteract the negative effects of poor school performance are discussed.

Understanding the structure of these communication networks is crucial to the success of wood products producers. This research illustrates the manner in which communication networks can be graphically modeled and quantified using techniques of social network analysis. Data were collected from a mid-sized softwood sawmill to examine the network of communications among employees. The native language of many of the employees was Spanish. Both production and management personnel were included in the sampling. Data were analyzed to produce a ''fingerprint'' of the communications structure within the organization, as well as indications of individual power within this structure. Results indicate that certain persons are gatekeepers for information flows between and among functional areas, as well as gatekeepers for information between management and production. These gatekeepers must be recognized in order to diffuse information efficiently throughout the workplace. This research illustrates the importance of communication networks in the manufacturing environment, especially for issues related to the interface between production and marketing.

The empirical strategy adopted is to apply a framework designed specifically to explain labor migration to the case of asylum migration, and the social networks approach is identified as the most appropriate. This paper examines the role of social networks through the asylum cycle, focusing on the decision to migrate, the choice of destination, and adaptation in the host society. The key conclusion is that the validity of the distinction between refugee and labor migration varies through the asylum cycle even for the same individual.

A sample of 294 men in treatment at a Department of Veterans Affairs Alcohol Treatment Unit was assessed during treatment and 3 months after discharge. Results of the cross-sectional structural equation analyses indicated that the personality characteristics of extraversion and neuroticism were related to both social network properties and perceived social support. Characteristics of the alcoholic's social network were also related to perceived availability of support. Longitudinal analyses of perceived social support after treatment indicated that two social network properties (size of the network and the proportion of confidants) were predictive net of initial levels of social support. Extraversion and neuroticism were found to be indirectly related to perceived social support at Time 2 through their effects on social network properties and perceived social support during treatment. implications of these findings for models of the nature and determinants of perceived social support are discussed.

The Adventist men were 11.2% more likely to be married (p<0.05), had 15% more trusted friends (p<0.10) and 31% more trusted relatives (p<0.005) than their neighbors. Of the Adventists and neighbors, 74% and 52% respectively reported feeling frequently cared for by others (p<0.001). At least weekly church attendance was practiced by 84% of the Adventists and 30% of the neighbors (p<0.001). It is speculated that some of the favorable mortality experience of Adventists may be causally related to these increased levels of social support.

Two analytical strategies, a variable-oriented approach and a subject-oriented approach, were used to complement each other: structural equation modeling assessed the direct relationship between social relationships and health, while cluster analysis examined how social relationship patterns were related to health outcomes. Lower levels of perceived social environment were associated with an increased number of hospital visits. For unmarried individuals, increased age was associated with greater medical usage and estimated total health care cost, while low perceived social environment was related to a greater number of dorter visits. Among married individuals, women had more frequent doctor visits, medication usage, estimated outpatient costs, and primary care visits. Married individuals with low levels of social networks had increased total health care costs, outpatient costs, and primary care visits. Cluster analysis was used to group individuals by characteristics of perceived social environment and social networks. Members of the cluster groups with greater health problems were more likely to be isolated, had the least social contact, and had lower levels of education and income. Including subject-oriented approaches is useful in complementing more popular regression methods for data analysis.

The paper studies the dynamic interaction of macro and micro levels in the marriage process. It is primarily concerned with the way in which the educational system structures the social network and describes the choice of young men and women. It is shown that in the course of expansion of higher educational attainment, the educational system increasingly influenced the marriage market, From age cohort to age cohort, homogamy has considerably increased, suggesting that social structure and social circles have become more exclusive within the process of modernization.

Special regard is laid to the social networks of the parents' generation as well as the children's generation. In a first step, four possible outcomes of intercultural contact situations are distinguished, namely integration, assimilation, segregation and marginalization. An explanatory model is proposed by relating these possible outcomes systematically to the availability of social and cultural capital within migrant families. Accordingly, the conditions for the outcome 'assimilation' are theoretically specified. The empirical analysis based on 400 father-son-dyads or mother-daughter-dyads, respectively shows that the social relations of Turkish migrant families rarely cross kinship lines. The theoretical model developed for the explanation of assimilation processes is empirically tested by using a structural equation model. As a main result, it can be stated that family resources and processes of intergenerative transmission are of major importance for the integration of Turkish migrants into the German society.

An ''Open Systems Role-Set Theory'' is applied to a qualitative case study of interchurch cooperation. This model examines the process through which this new organization resulted in changes in leaders' social networks, which led to changes in strategies for community outreach. Although this study focused specifically on an ecumenical alliance of religious congregations, leadership networks and coalitions generate cooperation and/or competition between agencies throughout the independent sector. One basic theme that emerges from this study suggests that the makeup of, and political dynamics within, leaders' role sets drive the process through which organizational decisions are made and resources are allocated.

Data are reported on the sample of 109 subjects who remained in the study through 3 months post-hospital discharge. Subjects experienced a fairly severe level of injury (mean injury severity of 15.5; mean of number of injuries 4.4) and are representative of an urban trauma population. The trimmed explanatory model demonstrated that 67% of the variance in postinjury disability was accounted for by postinjury functional limitations, post-traumatic psychological distress, pre-injury disability, and age. Age indirectly influenced postinjury disability through its effects on pre-injury functional limitations and pre-injury disability. Social network indirectly influenced disability through its effect on post-traumatic psychological distress. Patients whose maximal injuries involved the extremities and pelvic girdle had significantly higher levels of postinjury functional limitations than those with maximal injuries involving any other body system.

These contracting partners develop and demonstrate the new technology. This study distinguishes between two types of outcomes from such projects. Technology absorption is the adoption of a technology by an organization participating in the project. Technology transfer is the process by which outcomes are adopted by organizations outside the project (i.e., nonparticipants). From an evaluation perspective, research and development projects that result in the absorption of technology, without any subsequent transfer, are difficult to assess. Often these outcomes are counted the same as a transfer even though the process is subsidized by the state. Three case studies of absorption outcomes are presented. Absorption projects tend to be distinctive because: (a) they develop technologies that are very large in scale and very complex; (b) project leadership typically is provided by an end-user who attempts to employ the technology for commercial purposes; (c) success is measured through the technological accomplishment and ongoing commercial venture rather than by the number of adopting organizations; and (d) they produce spillover benefits in the cohesion of the social network; formed among project participants.

The procedure produced six network types significantly differentiated by the gender, age, education, years of residence in the country, and health status of the focal elders in the network. They are characterized respectively as (1) diversified, (2) friend and family, (3) narrow family focused, (4) attenuated, (5) religious family focused, and (6) traditional extended family support networks. Respondents in the different network types were found to have differing degrees of health service utilization, as measured on a combined index of nine health services. The healthiest respondents with the most diversified support networks made the greatest use, and those with family-focused networks made the least use of health services.

Using data from a survey of women belonging to voluntary associations in Yaounde, Cameroon, we find that the behavior and characteristics of the members of a respondent's personal networks are associated with her contraceptive use, over and above a set of her own individual characteristics that are usually found to be important. Respondents who report that their network partners approve of contraception, use it, and encourage the respondent to use are more likely to use contraception themselves; the association with encouragement is particularly strong. Moreover, there is a strong association between the specific methods of contraception used by a respondent and those used by her network partners, suggesting that members of personal networks exchange and evaluate specific methods. Because most of the respondent's network partners were interviewed, we are able to compare the respondent's perceptions of contraceptive use by her network partners with the network partner's actual use. We find that it is perceptions of use that matter, even if those perception are incorrect. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

This study found few differences in the structural and interactional characteristics of their social networks but found key differences in their perceptions of their relationships and interactions. Nonneglecting mothers approached relationships with a balance of independence and mutuality, and interactions were characterized by trust, reciprocity, and flexibility. Neglecting mothers were more dependent on others, and interactions were characterized by conflict, distrust, and lack of mutuality. The importance of considering perceptions of characteristics of social support in practice and research is discussed.		Beeman, SK (reprint author), UNIV MINNESOTA,MINNEAPOLIS,MN 55455, USA.

The first section describes alternative relationships between individuals and institutions in civil and uncivil societies. The second makes clear the important distinction between social network capital and organizational capital. The former can be used to achieve freedom from the state; the latter implies a trustworthy state. The third section presents empirical survey data from the New Democracies Barometer in nine post-Communist societies; the data measure trust, scepticism and distrust in fifteen institutions. The following sections use multivariate analysis to account for differences in individual levels of trust, and discuss the implications for theories of civic democracy.

Similarities between Texas birders and waterfowl hunters included race, years of experience, why they participated, and what prevented them from participating more in wildlife-related activities. Differences between groups in age, gender, source of income, age of initiation, and social networks (e.g., birding companions) revealed that Texas birders represented a unique subset of wildlife enthusiasts. Furthermore, Texas birders were highly committed to their pastime, spending almost 2.5 times the yearly amount spent by the waterfowl hunters in pursuit of birds, months in the field, trips, miles traveled, habitats, states, and countries visited, and organizational memberships. Birders did not perceive the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department as an organization that addressed their interests, i.e., they thought of wildlife management as benefiting primarily hunters and game species in Texas. We discuss methods of enhancing birding opportunities and promoting birding among Texas citizens.

Subjects were 499 inner-city injection drug users (IDUs) recruited from the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. Analysis of structural and functional network data indicates that a substantial proportion of drug sharing network members also provided social support, often because of family and sexual partner relationships. IDUs with larger drug networks which also provided social support were more likely to share needles, while IDUs with larger drug networks which did not provide social support were more likely to inject in commercial settings. The findings suggest that social support from drug network members has differential effects on injecting HIV-risk behaviors among IDUs. HIV prevention efforts should be expanded to reach drug-sharing networks and should lake into account their social support relationships. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

This study examined whether networks of drug-injecting and sexual relationships among drug injectors are associated with individual human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serostatus and with behavioral likelihood of future infection. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of 767 drug injectors in New York City was performed with chain-referral and linking procedures to measure large-scale (sociometric) risk networks. Graph-theoretic algebraic techniques were used to detect 92 connected components (drug injectors linked to each other directly or through others) and a 105-member 2-core within a large connected component of 230 members. Results. Drug injectors in the 2-core of the large component were more likely than others to be infected with HN. Seronegative 2-core members engaged in a wide range of high-risk behaviors, including engaging in risk behaviors with infected drug injectors. Conclusions. Sociometric risk networks seem to be pathways along which HIV travels in drug-injecting peer groups. The cores of large components can be centers of highrisk behaviors and can become pockets of HIV infection. Preventing HIV from reaching the cores of large components may be crucial in pre venting widespread MV epidemics.

Data support the hypotheses that social network size, contact volume, and composition vary with the age of the youngest child in a family. Childrearing reduces women's network size and contact volume, while it alters the composition of men's networks. Effects are most pronounced when the youngest child is around three years old. These results suggest the possibility that sex differences in structural location (in the sense of embeddedness in social networks) explain sex differences in outcomes over the life course. The gender-specific effects of this life stage may accrue because childrearing places men and women in separate social worlds; childbearing and childrearing thus may be a crucial phase in the process by which gender differences are created and maintained.

While there is a well-established literature on family care, social networks studies of the 1980s provided more comprehensive views of expressive and instrumental support across a range of relationships. Notwithstanding stereotypes to the contrary, older people contribute as well as receive support. A new generation of qualitative, interpretative studies are reporting on the meanings and processes of social support as experienced by older people themselves. policy-related studies examine social support as a cornerstone for community services, and epidemiological investigations examine social influence on health and well-being. The field could be advanced considerably by longitudinal surveys and qualitative enquiries exploring the diversify of older people in a variety of social settings.

This bind of focus, however, cannot address the more diffuse and disaggregated outcomes of globalization. This essay examines the convergent orientations and limitations of two influential anthropological renderings of transnational social and cultural fields. It then reviews the case of North American and European expatriates working on temporary labour contracts in the Cayman Islands, where insecure employment and residence conditions, cross-border mobility and a sense of displacement have not resulted in the development of a well-articulated transnational social network. In considering the implications of the Cayman case study, I suggest that anthropologists may have to accept the loss of collectivity as a conceptual and epistemological anchor in order to address the situations of the many unconnected travellers and migrants whose movements do not involve the reproduction of transnational aggregates.

I propose a model of ''learning in social networks'' to explain this diversify with the random dynamics of word-of-mouth communication. Women are uncertain about the merits of modern contraception and estimate the different qualities of available methods based on imprecise information from network partners. Their contraceptive choices ape determined by this estimate and by private knowledge about one's personal characteristics. This process of social learning leads to path-dependent adoption of fertility control within, and diversity in contraceptive practices across villages or social strata.

In this paper, we discuss the steps taken to develop a process evaluation plan for an ongoing eight-year, community-based br east cancel screening program (NC-BCSP) for African American women in five rural North Carolina counties. NC-BCSP builds on community networks, enhances the delivery of local screening services, and reduces health system barriers in the widely dispersed and resource-poor communities that comprise NC-BCSP's 2500-square mile region. This article includes a discussion of: the process evaluation's aims and scope, how and why we selected various methods and approaches, the challenges involved in launching the data collection process; early lessons learned about the resources needed for developing an effective process evaluation; and some of the advantages of gathering process data.

Four hundred sixty-nine couples who were obtaining marriage licenses for their first marriage were interviewed about their background characteristics; importance ratings of several reasons for marriage; reports of feelings and cognitions related to spouse, parents, and the two families; and reports of frequencies of interacting with spouse in different social contexts. Results revealed that individuals in the two types of marriage differed with respect to education background. Further analyses, controlling for effects of education background, revealed that participants in the two types of marriage varied with respect to endorsement of different reasons for marriage, feelings and cognitions concerning spouse and the families, and frequency of interaction in different social contexts. Differences between the sexes with respect to rated importance of different reasons for marriage and feelings for family were also found.

Using the North Carolina Breast Cancer Screening Program(NC-BCSP) as a case study this article describes the steps involved in developing, implementing, and evaluating an LHA intervention, considering factors that make the LHA approach appropriate for the NC-BCSP's population, setting, and health focus. The authors review five phases of implementation (start-up, training, LHA activities, follow-up, resource mobilization) and discuss the NC-BCSP's evaluation strategies and tools in light of difficulties involved in assessing natural helping processes and impact. Program challenges related to resource needs, identification of natural helpers, and LHA monitoring and support also are considered. The authors describe ways in which one large group of older, rural, African American LHAs are helping establish countywide partnerships between health care providers, agencies, and local communities that support and sustain individual changes in health behavior.

Studies have described and evaluated lay health advisor (LHA) programs that use social networks to improve individual and community health. The experience and perceptions of community members involved with LHA programs have been explored less often and offer essential information to health educators about the design, implementation, evaluation, and support of such programs. This article examines the perspective of LHAs in Detroit, Michigan. Their understanding and experience of their work, the relationships between their activities and a sense of self and community, and personal and programmatic rewards and challenges are examined. The authors discuss implications for health educators related to LHAs' roles, relationship to supporting organizations, recruitment, training, and ongoing support.

Given the robustness of shared information in determining group decisions, the authors propose the concept of a sociocognitive network that captures the degree of members' knowledge-sharing prior to group interaction. A link connecting a given pair of members represents the amount of information that the pair shares before interaction. As in a regular social network, a member's status can be defined by the centrality in the network; the more information a member shares with others, the more cognitively central the member is in the group. The authors hypothesized that a cognitively central member would acquire pivotal power in a group and exert more influence on consensus than would peripheral members, independently of the member's preference majority or minority status The results of two studies supported these predictions.

Methods: In order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality-of-life study. We report an the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients (45) and their mothers (35) covering difficulties and problems in general, most as aspects of their medical histology, self image, body image and current life with or without a male or female partner. Results: The patients were socially competent with a well developed social network. However, regarding sexual contacts they were shy and reluctant. These resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are married. Existing partnerships were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population. The incidence of homosexuality was not increased. The number of women having children was significantly reduced. A substantial number of women suffered from androgen-dependent problems like irrgular menses and hirsutism. Mothers and patients denied any sex-specific eduction, hut the girls had preferred boy-specific toys and competitive outdoor games. However,school performance was average and comparable to the controls. Most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters intersexuality at birth. Even though they felt they had received good medical treatment, mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help. Conclusions: It seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease. Problems regarding partnership, sexuality, and fertility remain and have to be addressed.		Kuhnle, U (reprint author), UNIV MUNICH,KINDERKLIN,LINDWURMSTR 4,D-80337 MUNICH,GERMANY.

Relative to fathers in traditional childbirth classes, those in father-focused discussion classes significantly increased their use of reasoning during conflicts and their housework activity. Both groups of fathers reported a significant increase in social network support and an increase in baby/pregnancy-related activity. Neither group substantially increased their overall coping responses, although men in the father-focused group significantly changed their coping efforts by seeking more social support, particularly getting information and emotional support from their partner's physician. Implications for perinatal education practice are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

The segregation matrix index (SMI), which is based on the relative number and intensity of inward to outward interactions, serves as a measure of the cohesiveness of a group (Fershtman and Chen, 1993, Megamot, 34: 563-581). Based on the SMI, the paper proposes an operational definition of a cohesive group and an algorithm for detecting cohesive groups in (binary or valued) social networks. Examination of two actual cases demonstrates the efficiency of the algorithm.

Charges of inefficiency and clientelism are sustained through reference to its problematic public profile and the questionable impartiality and integrity of its administrative apparatus (Pizanias 1994). Nevertheless, in most of these over-generalized accounts, the Greek state bureaucracy is largely depicted as a homogeneously passive, or at least 'neutral' social actor, heavily dependent upon the powerful political parties' apparatus. Herzfeld (1992), in his ethnographic study of the Greek public administration, provides us with a different and more in-depth view of its operation. According to him, Creek state bureaucracy is not only inefficient and clientelism-driven, but is also characterized by a high degree of formalization. Herzfeld treats formalism primarily as the cultural basis of petty bureaucratic tyranny and indifference. Contrary to that, I do not view the problem of bureaucratic formalism merely in ethical or cultural terms in so far as the formalistic enforcement of law is still considered, by certain administrators, as the ultimate means for protecting the integrity of the public domain of interactions from extra-institutional interference and pressures. It is this central assumption that the paper wants to challenge by examining the complex interrelations between formalism and the establishment of certain predominantly clientelist extra-institutional, social networks within the public domain of the state bureaucracy. This project is empirically based in the implementation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) measures by the Directorate of Agriculture, a public administrative agency in Phthiotis, central Greece.

The analysis also describes the important role of social networks in the institutionalization of the discipline, including the establishment of the Latin American Sociology of Work Association in 1993.

A method to determine the contact patterns of adults that may lead to the spread of airborne infections	PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article							SEXUAL NETWORKS; ENGLAND; EPIDEMIOLOGY; VACCINATION; MEASLES; HIV; COMMUNITY; WALES; MEN	Although mixing patterns are thought to be important determinants of the spread of airborne infectious diseases, to our knowledge, there have been no attempts to directly quantify them for humans. We report on a preliminary study to identify such mixing patterns. A sample of 92 adults were asked to detail the individuals with whom they had conversed over the period of one, randomly assigned, day. Sixty-five (71%) completed the questionnaire, providing their age, the age of their contacts and the social context in which the contacts took place. The data were analysed using multilevel modelling. The study identified, and allowed the quantification of, contact patterns within this sample that may be of epidemiological significance. For example, the degree of assortativeness of mixing with respect to age was dependent not only on the age of participants but the number of contacts made. Estimates of the relative magnitude of contact rates between different social settings were made, with implications for outbreak potential. Simple questionnaire modifications are suggested which would yield information on the structure and dynamics of social networks and the intensity of contacts.

The similarity in pin morphology and decoration suggests an increasing level of social integration among groups that were shifting from a residential mobility strategy to a logistically organized one. The development of amplification of intergroup social networks provided access to information and resources that were formerly obtained through more direct forms of intergroup contact. The spatial distribution of selected bone pin styles suggests that these social networks extended over a considerable portion of the southern Midwest. Collectively, these data suggest that regional social networks existed in this part of the Midwest much earlier than previously believed.

The use of social networks generally takes place within the ranks of sociology, However, a more complete social science would result by combining work being done on social networks within sociology with mainline economic theory. The insights from such a research agenda will help us better understand socioeconomic behavior. With this in mind, the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate the utility of the network metaphor to economists. This objective will be accomplished through developing four basic components of social networks, and using them to navigate through the existing literature in economic sociology, Furthermore, topics for future research in which social networks can provide contributions to the explanation of socioeconomic behavior are explored as well.

We aim to determine whether social network size is related to the likelihood of hospitalisation and the amount of service use. Method As par to a prospective controlled study, baseline interview data for a random sample of one-year prevalent cases with non-organic psychosis were analysed with respect to social network characteristics and service use during a six-month period. Results The likelihood of hospitalisation decreased with an increase in network size, while the number of services used by patients grew as the social network size increased. Conclusions While larger social networks may be associated with a lower likelihood of hospitalisation, they may also be related to wider use of non-hospital services.

Conversely, the data revealed fragmented social networks involving various social groups, categories of people, and an ''in/out'' culture. The article also identifies a range of social dynamics associated with the scene, including commercial pressures, sexualization, and gender negotiations. Network characteristics and dynamics tend to work against the establishment of close and supportive friendships. Social influences on the adoption of ''safe sex'' are also discussed.

Relationships of the SCL-S to types of work, health satisfaction, psychological traits, current medication, and stress coping were also tentatively analyzed. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to employees of a railroad company, of whom 1,706 men aged 18 to 55 were selected randomly and 1,045 (61.3%) responded. The SCL-S consists of 30 items, each of which is scored 1 or 0, depending on whether or not a symptom is present. The SCL-S score is defined as the summation of each binary datum. Health satisfaction is scored as 1 (satisfied), 2 (moderately satisfied), or 3 (not satisfied). The psychological trait item is scored as 1 (extrovert) or 2 (introvert). Present medication is scored as 1 (yes) or 0 (no). We also asked the respondents whether they had experienced stress coping, hobbies and consultation with others. Each of these items was scored as 1 (yes) or 0 (no). There was a difference in the mean SCL-S value among age-groups as a whole (p<0.05). Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the target group was 0.817. Principal factor analysis was conducted on 30 items of the SCL-S. Three factors were extracted. Factor 1 consisted of three items which related to motivation. Factor 2 consisted of six items which related to physical symptoms. Factor 3 consisted of six items which related to symptoms of autonomic imbalance. These three factors explained only 18.2% of total variation. The mean SCL-S value was quite high in the groups characterized by introversion (p<0.01), having no one to consult (p<0.05), and not having a hobby (p<0.01). The higher health satisfaction score was, the lower the mean value of the SCL-S and this was significant (p<0.01). Multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict SCL-S scores by other variables. Significant standardized partial regression coefficient items increasing the SCL-S value were introversion trait (p<0.05), not having a hobby (p<0.05), and health dissatisfaction (p<0.01). Among these three variables, health dissatisfaction contributed most to the SCL-S. The adjusted coefficient of determination was 0.185. These results raise the possibility that the SCL-S can be based on division into three differ ent scales. Internal consistency was nearly acceptable with the adoption of an alpha value over 0.8. In addition, health satisfaction was most closely related to subjectively reported stress or stress response judged by SCL-S.

Despite considerable progress in the epidemiology of late life depression, little data have been documented in the scientific literature on depressive symptoms among elderly African Americans. The present investigation identifies characteristic symptoms of depression in African American community-resident elders. Method. Ninety-six African American men and women aged 60 years and older, with equal representation from urban and rural counties in west Tennessee, composed the sample. The sample was stratified in each of the two counties into three age categories; 60-69, 70-79, and 80 and older. Data from the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression scale were compared with the association of medical illness, medication use, social network, level of physical function in activities of daily living, and demographic characteristics. Results. Residents screening positive for the presence of depressive symptoms showed an increased report of hypertension (p < .036), arteriosclerosis (p < .035), and circulatory problems (p < .008). There was an increased report of symptoms of depression among those who had six or more different chronic illnesses (p < .001) and among those who reported using four or more different prescription medications in the past month for chronic illnesses (p < .015). Regression analyses of data indicated that medical illness (p < .001) and social network (p < .041) were the most important predictors of depressive symptoms among residents. Conclusions. Considering the projected increase of African Americans reaching age 60, and because depressive illness is an important public heath concern, early identification of salient risk factors for depression is critical in instituting early intervention programs for the ethnic minority elderly population.

Instead of conceiving these recombinations as accidental aberrations, it explores their evolutionary potentials. Its starting premise is that the actual unit of entrepreneurship is not the isolated individual personality but the social networks that link firms and the actors within them. Drawing on recent developments in evolutionary theory, it cautions that although all-encompassing privatization and marketization might foster adaptation in the short run, the consequent loss of organizational diversity will impede adaptability in the long run.

Sixty families in which both parents were either younger than 26 or older than 29 when they began childbearing, and whose child was between the ages of 3 and 5 at the time of the study participated. Videotaped observations of father-child play were collected. Questionnaires were also administered to fathers, assessing their marital satisfaction, work-horne compatibility, and social network attributes. Older fathers established stronger connections to extra-familial contexts and displayed greater reliance on verbal mechanisms to engage children during play. Younger fathers maintained a more traditional style of fathering and engaged their children through physical stimulation. The implications of these findings for models of father-child relationships were explored.

This study examines the association between religious involvement and depression in older Dutch citizens and focuses on models of the mechanism in which religious involvement has an impact on other factors related to depression. The subjects were 2,817 older adults aged 55-85 years living in the community who participated in the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Religious involvement was assessed using items on frequency of church attendance and strength of church affiliation, Further data were collected on physical health, size of social network, social support, sense of mastery and self-esteem. As in North American studies, religious involvement appeared to be inversely associated with depression, both on symptom and syndrome levels. Controlling for sociodemographics, physical impairment and network support did not substantially affect this association, particularly among subjects aged 75-85 years. The inverse association between religious involvement and depression was not selectively more pronounced among older people with physical impairments. However, the association appeared to be most specific for subjects with a small social network and those with a low sense of mastery.

The study is part of a larger international comparative research project coordinated by the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris. This text is based on data collected in the two cities during 1993-94: Forty secondary school teachers in St. Petersburg and thirty-eight in Helsinki kept a diary of their important social relations for two weeks. Each evening during this period they recorded their significant social encounters of the day in structured questionnaires; eg. whom they met and what they did or discussed together. After the two weeks, they added to the diaries persons whom they had not encountered during the study period but whom they nevertheless considered as significant for their social life. In addition, a complementary theme interview concentrating on their life course was carried out. Clear differences were found between the informal exchange practices of Russian and Finnish respondents. Compared to their Finnish colleagues, Russian teachers exchanged more favours, goods and important information. Moreover, the content of the informal exchange in St. Petersburg was both of a different nature and more diverse than in Helsinki; cases abounded of Russian respondents having to use their relatives, friends, colleagues or acquaintances in order to obtain informally products or different kinds of services (eg. medical care). Similarly, half of the Russian respondents reported blat exchanges-a particular Soviet/post-Soviet phenomenon of arranging things through informal connections, and a practice not found in the Finnish data. The informal exchanges reported in the St. Petersburg data were more often carried out with colleagues or other work-mediated relations, thereby stressing the importance of the Russian workplace as a social milieu. In the Russian data the informal exchange relations also involved more examples of informal exchange mediated by a third person, whereas in Helsinki the relations were more of a dyadic nature. The results support the view proposed by previous research according to which informal exchange and patterns of behavior inherited from the socialist era still continue to influence the transition society. The continuing lack of trust in official institutions and social services was compensated for by our Russian respondents with the use of their personal relations. The trust necessary for informal exchanges to take place was guaranteed either through the use of brokers or a common social context, particularly the workplace. The resulting forms of social life can be characterized as personalized (since abstract and therefore replacable relations were turned into personal and unique ones) and mediated (since the brokers were often used). Though changing in forms and functions, the networks of personal relations still continue to play a significant role in the life of post-Soviet citizens.

Design.-After reporting the extent of participation in 12 types of social ties (eg, spouse, parent, friend, workmate, member of social group), subjects were given nasal drops containing 1 of 2 rhinoviruses and monitored for the development of a common cold. Setting.-Quarantine. Participants.-A total of 276 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 55 years, neither seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus nor pregnant. Outcome Measures.-Colds (illness in the presence of a verified infection), mucus production, mucociliary clearance function, and amount of viral replication. Results.-In response to both viruses, those with more types of social ties were less susceptible to common colds, produced less mucus, were more effective in ciliary clearance of their nasal passages, and shed less virus. These relationships were unaltered by statistical controls for prechallenge virus-specific antibody, virus type, age, sex, season, body mass index, education, and race. Susceptibility to colds decreased in a dose-response manner with increased diversity of the social network. There was an adjusted relative risk of 4.2 comparing persons with fewest (1 to 3) to those with most (6 or more) types of social ties. Although smoking, poor sleep quality, alcohol abstinence, low dietary intake of vitamin C, elevated catecholamine levels, and being introverted were all associated with greater susceptibility to colds, they could only partially account for the relation between social network diversity and incidence of colds. Conclusions.-More diverse social networks were associated with greater resistance to upper respiratory illness.

The source of such variation is often ascribed to individual differences, but much of it is due to how IDUs are grouped into social networks. Nevertheless, given the turbulent and uncertain lives red by many IDUs, it would not be surprising if their social networks changed substantially over time. We used data from a study of the social networks of IDUs in Chicago and Washington, DC, to examine changes in individual behavior and network characteristics over time; The results indicated few changes in standard network measures, such as density of ties or network size, over time. However, specific network change measures, that is, indicators of movement into and out of networks, showed significant movement of network members over time. Moreover, movement of members into a network significantly predicted a higher likelihood of risky injection drug use over time. We suggest that these movements are indicative of a lack of a stable resource base among IDU networks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

However, many information-gathering tasks are better handled by finding a referral to a human expert rather than by simply interacting with online information sources. A personal referral allows a user to judge the quality of the information he or she is receiving as well as to potentially obtain information that is deliberately not made public. The process of finding an expert who is both reliable and likely to respond to the user can be viewed as a search through the network of social relationships between individuals as opposed to a search through the network of hypertext documents. The goal of the REFERRAL WEB Project is to create models of social networks by data mining the web and develop tools that use the models to assist in locating experts and related information search and evaluation tasks.

What is known about the effectiveness of partner notification is summarized and five general findings are reported: (1) many, if not most, HIV-infected individuals will cooperate in notifying at least some of their sex partners of exposure to HIV; (2) sex partners are generally, receptive to being notified and will seek HIV testing; (3) patient referral is probably not as effective as provider referral in reaching sex partners; (4) sex partners often are unaware of or misunderstand their HIV risks; and (5) sex partners frequently have high rates of HIV infection. Means for enhancing partner notification are reviewed, including social network interventions, coupling partner notification with behavioral interventions, reaching persons earlier in their HIV infection, using data collected from partner notification as a source of program evaluation information, and addressing important community concerns about partner notification.

This study analyzed the long-term association between religious attendance and mortality to determine whether the association is explained by improvements in health practices and social connections for frequent attenders. Methods. The association between frequent attendance and mortality over 28 years for 5286 Alameda County Study respondents was examined. Logistic regression models analyzed associations between attendance and subsequent improvements in health practices and social connections. Results. Frequent attenders had lower mortality rates than infrequent attenders (relative hazard [RH] = 0.64: 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.53, 0.77). Results were stronger for females. Health adjustments had little impact, but adjustments for social connections and health practices reduced the relationship (RH = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.64, 0.93). During follow-up, frequent attenders were more likely to stop smoking, increase exercising, increase social contacts, and stay married. Conclusions. Lower mortality rates for frequent religious attenders are partly explained by improved health practices, increased social contacts, and more stable marriages occurring in conjunction with attendance. The mechanisms by which these changes occur have broad intervention implications.

This report describes the salience of social networks to the phenomena of adolescent weapon carrying. Methods. A random-walk net work sampling design was used to survey 113 adolescents about topics, including weapon carrying. Results. In a probability sample of 12- to 15-year-olds, 20.9% reported ever carrying a weapon. Carriers were eight times as likely as noncarriers to report weapon carrying by an older associate, and 19 times as likely to report weapon carrying by a peer. A significant dose-response effect was present. Conclusions. This evidence supports the interpretation thar modeling of weapon carrying by personal network members is important for its initiation and maintenance in adolescence.

Relationships between the numerous participants in state policy-making are examined through research on policy forums in the economic domain. Policy forums are defined as institutional settings for encounters between state and non-state organizations, through their elites; importantly, these encounters establish exchange relationships among the participants in economic policy-making processes. This article homes in on one important dimension of these relationships: the network structure of ties within and among policy forums. Interlocking data serve as indicators of the ties among the participants in policy forums. As the research presented here illustrates, the significance of policy forum networks rests not in their formal functions, but rather in their structure and with the elite persons who sit on their boards.

Implications for physician-patient communication	CANCER EPIDEMIOLOGY BIOMARKERS & PREVENTION			English	Article							BREAST-CANCER; SCREENING MAMMOGRAPHY; OLDER WOMEN; CHANNEL SELECTION; HEALTH PROMOTION; PRIMARY-CARE; BLACK-WOMEN; PREVENTION; INTERVENTIONS; SERVICES	The present study examines women's decision making about mammography over a 1-year period, using ''decisional balance,'' a summary of women's positive and negative perceptions about mammography derived from the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). Data were from a survey of women ages 50-74 years who completed both the baseline and 1-year follow-up telephone surveys (n = 1144) for an intervention study to increase the use of mammography screening, A shift toward less favorable perceptions about mammography was related to being a smoker and not having a recent clinical breast examination and Pap test, Change in women's attitudes toward mammography was also related to four dimensions of a woman's information environment, Women who rated the opinions of a physician as somewhat or not important, those who reported that at least one family member or friend discouraged them from having a mammogram, and women who felt they lacked enough people in their social network with whom they could discuss health concerns were less likely to express favorable attitudes about mammography over 1 year, In contrast, women who consistently communicated the value of mammography to others expressed more favorable views of screening over the study period, Interventions designed to promote breast cancer screening must recognize that a woman not only reacts to mammography information provided by significant others in her social network but may preactively reach out to others as an advocate of breast cancer screening, thus reinforcing or changing others' opinions or behavior as well as her own.

Health is a major intervening variable, and its relationship to work output is a special concern of this research. We suggest that this model may be used as a template to explain human. productivity in most societies. Its universality can be subjected to rigorous testing in a range of settings from tropical upland swidden horticulturalists to urban workers in a northern industrialized country. Observations are offered on some of those testing sites and on methodological issues implicit in research of this breadth. A major pilot study of urban Chinese workers has already demonstrated the predictive power of the model in one setting.		Steegmann, AT (reprint author), SUNY BUFFALO,BUFFALO,NY 14261, USA.

Respondents of the Living With Arthritis project were classified into four participation pattern categories. Results confirmed that elder adults with arthritis are more likely to experience changes to their activity regimen than older adults without arthritis. a multi-group discriminant function analysis showed that arthritis severity distinguished those who tend to cease activity, Social network and age best distinguished those who quit activities without replacement. Results are placed in the context of coping strategies.

Using information from ethnographic fieldwork, colonial archives, and air photography, two agricultural groups migrating into an agricultural frontier in the Nigerian savanna are compared. Population density in Kofyar communities has risen to over 100/km(2); Tiv communities, although older, have maintained population densities of around 50/km(2), in part through intimidation of encroachers. This use of intimidation is a component of a distinctive adaptive strategy that includes settlement stability, high population mobility tied to witchcraft accusations, relatively extensive cultivation allowing considerable off-time, and reliance on social networks to facilitate residential mobility and land access. Population pressure must be seen as an integral part of this adaptive strategy, rather than as cause or consequence.

To investigate predictors of change in the sense of competence of primary caregivers and continuity in home care for dementia patients. Design. A prospective longitudinal study with a follow-up period of 10 months. Setting. Dementia patients living in the community selected by Dutch general practitioners. Subjects. Pairs of demented patients and their primary caregivers (N = 138). Main outcome measures. Sense of competence: a 27-item scale (alpha = 0.79) based on issues derived from the family crisis model and the Burden Interview. Continuity in home care is determined by the number of patient's admissions to a nursing or retirement home. Results. Regression analysis revealed that a change in the caregiver's sense of competence was independently predicted by characteristics of the patient, the primary caregiver and the professional social network. A decreased sense of competence was associated with a longer duration of dementia and the patient's more agitated behaviour, the caregiver's higher initial sense of competence and being a female caregiver sharing a household with the demented patient. A positive influence on the change in the sense of competence was found when these females received a professional intervention consisting of support for the caregiver. Reporting to be a Catholic or a Protestant compared with not being religiously involved positively influenced the change in sense of competence. Logistic regression analysis identified that continuity in home care was predicted by characteristics of the demented patient and the professional social network of the patient. Predictors of continuation of home care were: lower severity of dementia, patient's higher ADL impairment, the intervention and involvement of regular home help. Institutionalization was more likely when the patient's behaviour was more apathetic and a district nurse was involved in the care. Conclusions. Caregiver characteristics influenced the change in sense of competence but did not influence the risk for institutionalization. Findings suggest that health professionals should pay attention to the negative consequences of agitated behaviour and to the most vulnerable group, females sharing a household with the demented patient.

We observed four immature female and four immature male langurs-all members of the same free-ranging multimale multifemale group in Ramnagar, South Nepal-from November 1992 to February 1993 for 288 hr via focal-animal and instantaneous sampling techniques. Immature females spent significantly more time in proximity to other group members than immature males did. They had more physical contact and groomed more. Other immature females were their preferred social partners. Immature males also preferred like-aged females. They restricted their relationships with other immature males to proximity and occasional grooming. Monitoring was directed especially toward adult males. Female behavior can be interpreted as oriented toward integration into the female social network and their age-inverted dominance hierarchy. Males seem to prepare intrasexual competition.

Grounded theory was adapted and discourse analysis used to retrospectively analyse data collected for a previous study exploring health visitors' support of patients with breast cancer. Patients' diagrams of their social networks illustrated their perceptions of support and strain. Respondents indicated that they faced six threats to their identities associated with the breast cancer experience and perceived social support to be actions/attitudes from formal or informal sources which maintained or assisted changes to their established identities. Social support maintained identities for many respondents who wanted to 'get back to normal' in their relationships and in their work. Women also needed support to, accept identity changes, for example, adapting to an uncertain future. This paper focuses on the effects of informal support on identity. Respondents identified seven main types of informal support from various sources. Larger social networks were more likely to provide the different types of support needed. However, social intimacy of close relationships maintained important aspects of women's identities and were indeed part of their identities. Respondents' social contacts sometimes perceived breast cancer as threatening to their own identities and were consequently unsupportive. Informal support was vital for respondents coping with breast cancer. Nurses should help patients maintain and create their own informal support during illness.

Children classified as aggressive and nonaggressive were both highly selective in their peer affiliations, spending the majority of their time with a few same-sex classmates. Children generally established strong, stable, mutual affiliations with peers similar to themselves in aggression, but aggressive children had more difficulty establishing such affiliations. The interaction of peer dyads containing at least one aggressive child were characterized by more frequent, lengthy, and intense conflicts regardless of the affiliative relationship characterizing the dyad. The amount of time children spent interacting with aggressive peers predicted changes in observed and teacher-rated aggressiveness 3 months later.

Furthermore. these elements of treatment may play an intermediate role in the connection between client background characteristics and later criminal activity. The current study examines a structural equation model including client perceptions of their drug related problems, peer deviance, and family dysfunction as influences upon the formation of therapeutic relationships during treatment and rearrests following treatment. Results showed therapeutic relationships were positively associated with recognition of drug related problems and negatively related to rearrest. Peer deviance also was positively related to rearrest. (C) 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.		Broome, KM (reprint author), TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIV,INST BEHAV RES,TCU BOX 298740,FT WORTH,TX 76129, USA.

In the first study conducted in 1988 - a free recall technique was employed, whereas the second study, starting from 1990, used a recognition technique in generating egocentered networks. It was shown that both techniques lead to different networks not only with respect to morphological features of social networks, but also and more importantly with respect to functional and relational features. The recognition technique seems to be useful in collecting exchange networks with high numbers of network members and strong activity, while free recall produces networks which are smaller and less active in comparison, but nevertheless can be identified as networks of significant others.

Mothers provided descriptions of their own social networks and of their child's adjustment. Child reports of network size and composition varied by ethnicity and maternal marital status, with children from intact, Euro-American homes reporting the fewest network members and those from intact, Mexican-American families reporting the most. No significant group differences emerged in child reports of the amount of, or satisfaction with, support received. The children's reports of total frequency of receiving support were associated with lower rates of externalizing behaviors. Similarly, children whose mothers reported more supportive networks were rated as lower in externalizing behavior, regardless of marital status or ethnicity. In regression analyses, both the mothers' reports of support and the children's reports of support contributed significantly to the prediction of externalizing behaviors.

The measure, based on social exchange theory and equity theory, has two subscales, one for support and the other for conflict. As yet, few measurements have been developed to assess conflict from within social networks. As part of a larger longitudinal study a sample of 166 first-time shelter users was administered the inventory. A student sample also filled out the inventory for comparison purposes. Internal consistency for both subscales was good, .90 for Support and .83 for Conflict. Weak interitem correlations were prevalent among many items in the Conflict subscale. A nearly zero correlation was found between scores on the Support and Conflict subscales, suggesting independence. An exploratory factor analysis using varimax rotation confirmed a dual factor structure. Analyses of variance and Scheffe contrast tests detected no statistically significant differences between age groups on either the Support or the Conflict subscales. A multiple regression analysis indicated that, when controlling for age, scores on the Support scale discriminated the homeless and student samples, while scores on the Conflict subscale do not. The Support subscale indicates excellent psychometric qualities, while the Conflict subscale should be refined.

Measures included socioeconomic indexes, symptoms, diagnoses, and adjustment, As expected, socioeconomic and illness factors were interrelated in this sample. Diagnosis was related to both functioning and socioeconomic factors. As a rule, participants were financially impoverished but socially integrated into social networks consisting largely of kin. In spite of impoverishment and presence of significant symptoms, most were maintaining themselves in the community with at least marginal functioning, though they received very little support from the menial health system beyond medication. Compared with the younger cohort, the older cohort was functioning better had fewer symptoms, and had better global adjustment. Those with coexisting psychotic and affective syndromes were most at risk. Future analyses with this data set will need to develop complex multivariate models to predict the primary influences on functioning and short-term stability.

The mixed-methods design included a qualitative study and a survey administered by e-mail (187 subjects in eleven electronic forums). Data were also retrieved from LISTSERV archives to determine each forum's profile in terms of contribution rate, adoption rate, and numb of active contributors. The authors found that there was transient membership in the forums, a pattern of ''few-to-many'' exchange, and weak engagement with other forum members. However, the interaction generated by a small group of contributors seems to present scholars with a new social arena that may fulfill their affiliation and information needs.

Research has begun to show that social ties influence the ways in which immigrants find jobs in a host community. This research investigates how social ties affect immigrants' employment status and wages, and how these effects may depend on community social-class composition. Methods. Data used are from a pilot survey of Salvadorean and Pilipino immigrants in two Los Angeles communities. Analyses are conducted with probit models and ordinary least squares regression models corrected for selection. Results. The findings, unlike those in many previous studies, show that strong social ties, such as family ties, affect employment status and wages. The effects, however, differ by gender. Among men, working with relatives is associated with higher wages. Among women, having non-coresident relatives in the United States is associated with higher wages. The latter finding is most plausibly a social-network effect among Salvadorean women, who live in a working-class community. Conclusions. These findings suggest that social ties are important determinants of the wage-earning potential of immigrants, and that the effects of social ties depend on community characteristics such as social-class composition.

A potential investor needs market opportunities in order to earn profit, business organization to exploit the opportunity, and capital to initiate the business. In Taiwan's network economy, the solidarity provided by ''family'' networks makes small initial business organizations possible. Subcontracting systems, both horizontal and vertical, make the entry-level investment low, and the decentralized production/marketing processes provide numerous market opportunities for small investments. Taiwanese entrepreneurs opt to start their business ventures primarily through the use of network financing, since bank loans fall under the dominion of government policies.

Spreading disease and disorder can be interpreted as indices of the resulting social disintegration, which is driven by policy. This ''failure of containment'' in the United States should serve as a warning for cities in Europe against reducing the municipal and other services that they provide to ''unpopular'' subpopulations.

Comparisons were made to matched groups of children who were developing typically and to children with communication disorders. Results showed more limited peer social networks for both groups of children with disabilities based primarily on the frequency of contacts with peers and linkages established across school and community settings. All three groups were indistinguishable from one another on numerous measures of peer social networks, including duration and quality of individual relationships and participation in organized group activities with peers. Groups also differed on parental arranging and monitoring, which appeared to be related to children's developmental level.

However, most people act out their daily lives involved in social networks in which they exchange money, goods, services, emotional support, etc., with kin, friends, neighbours, etc. From the qualitative analysis of 78 interviews with older persons living independently in the community, the concept 'independence' was found to include interdependence. When asked to define and describe their independence, participants illustrated how they were not dependent and they were not powerless. The key concepts in the maintenance of their independence lifestyle are control, mediation and reciprocation of assistance. It is concluded that the assessment of independence, and the development of programs aimed at promoting independence, should be expanded to include participation within unique interdependent networks.

The 'synergism of plagues'-a self-reinforcing, interactive mix of contagious urban decay and deterioration in both public health and public order-emerges in the course of a sudden 'phase transition' from community-spanning geographically focused social networks within ghetto neighborhoods to a condition of fragmented and isolated subnets. This transition occurs because instabilities inherent in the marginalization of ethnic ghetto neighborhoods synergistically amplify externally imposed stressors, most notably public policies of disinvestment. The amplification, a short-time version of stochastic resonance, may be quite large. Our work implies that continued subjection of marginalized US urban minority neighborhoods to public policies of 'planned shrinkage' can trigger similar but larger scale-regional and national-transitions in patterns of public health and public order, ultimately placing much of the three quarters of the country's population living in or near central cities at significantly increased risk.

But what criteria do professionals use to determine the appropriate treatment? These issues were the subject of this study. Interviewers used a five-part in-depth interview protocol with twenty-five substance abuse specialists to determine the assessment criteria used to place clients in particular treatment modalities. The interviews consisted of five parts: (1) a review of recent clients' characteristics, (2) a discussion of five fictional client case descriptions; (3) an assessment factor ranking exercise, (4) a writing assignment designed to elicit key assessment questions from respondents; and, (5) an exercise designed to determine how assessment results are used in the treatment placement process. Data analysis revealed high congruence across the five different interview approaches, and the case study exercise produced a high degree of consistency among respondents' placement selections. The primary assessment criteria that professionals apply were as follows: past and present substance abuse; past treatment experiences (with special weight attributed to prior treatment failures); motivation for treatment; family and social networks, mental health problems; and treatment facilities' ability to address special client needs.

The focus is on how individual and community health relate to institutional missions, purposes, and goals. This framework may be applied to 2-year and 4-year colleges and universities whether they are public, private, research, teaching, sectarian, religious, residential, or commuter institutions. The following questions are addressed: Why should colleges maintain healthy communities? How do we define health in colleges and universities? Why is this important for society? What are the key responsibilities in fostering healthy educational communities? Who is responsible for assuring that this happens? What added value do personal and community health yield for institutions of higher education? Readers are provided with a rationale for assessing the role and importance of individual and community health in their campus environments; engaging students, faculty, and staff in discussions about these issues; and determining whether more thorough, systematic, and intensive community health assessments or interventions are needed in their campus settings.

They also focus on explaining why certain innovations diffuse extensively, becoming de facto standards, whereas others do so partially or not at all. Many of these theories specify a bandwagon process: a positive feedback loop in which increases in the number of adopters create stronger bandwagon pressures, and stronger bandwagon pressures, in turn, cause increases in the number of adopters. Factors affecting if and how many times this feedback loop cycles explain if and how many potential adopters jump on a bandwagon. We argue that one important factor has not yet been incorporated into theories explaining bandwagons' extent: the structure of social networks through which potential adopters of innovations find out information about these innovations which can cause them to adopt these innovations. We advance a theory of how the structure of social networks affects bandwagons' extent. We propose that both the number of network links, as well as small, seemingly insignificant idiosyncracies of their structures, can have very large effects on the extent of an innovation's diffusion among members of a social network.

Having friends is correlated with a sense of wellbeing across the life span, but developmental outcome also depends on the identity of one's friends as well as the quality of one's relationships with them. Greater attention needs to be given to the manner in which friendships differ from one another, continuities and changes across major developmental transitions, and differentiation of developmental pathways through which friendship experience contributes to individual outcome.

All female cluster patients treated at the neurologic clinic of the hospital were included, and consecutive outpatients, who had been referred to the policlinics for diagnosis and treatment, whose symptoms agreed with the IHS criteria for migraine and who had ages matching the cluster headache patients, participated in the study, Results: In the semiprojective coping tests the cluster headache patients were found to be statistically significant more 'positive' as to their anticipated activities in the future compared to the migraine patients (p < 0.04), No other statistical differences were found between the two groups, Compared to randomly selected and age-matched referents in the population: cluster headache patients reported significantly poorer social support (is < 0.01), while no other difference was found when the migraine patients were compared with controls, Conclusions: The findings indicate that there are differences in perception of anticipated activities and social support between patients with cluster headache and migraine.

This research tests four perspectives an social relations and quality of life, all of which hold that dimensions of networks shape life satisfaction by affecting self-esteem. However, these perspectives disagree about which particular dimension is consequential: relationships with Insiders vs. Outsiders, the extent of supportive relationships, or the number of negative ties. We test these perspectives using longitudinal data an 137 individuals with chronic mental illness. Results show that the proportion of Insiders or Outsiders makes little difference for quality of life. However, increases in the number of supportive relationships improves life quality. Moreover, negative interactions have a strong detrimental effect on life satisfaction. Further analyses show that supportive and negative relationships affect life quality, respectively, by increasing or decreasing individuals' self-esteem.

We use confirmatory factor analysis to test a multidimensional model of social networks using data from a large epidemiologic study of community-dwelling adults age 65 and over (U.S.A.). Confirmatory factor analysis conducted using LISREL showed that our model provides a good fit to the data after several adjustments for correlated measurement error were introduced. Based on this analysis, we developed new measures of four dimensions and a summary index of social networks. Bivariate relationships between our new measures and several sociodemographic variables of interest are also presented. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

We address this deficiency by (a) returning LMX research to its historical roots in exchange processes by introducing a framework for understanding relationship quality that is based on reciprocity, and (b) extending the traditional domain of LMX research beyond the formal leader-subordinate relationship in order to offer ct more complete explanation of the differentiation process. We employ insights derived from social network analysis to describe how social structure facilitates the exchange processes through which leaders assist in incorporating some members into the inner life of an organization but exclude others.

An interpretive research approach provided the basis for the research design. The Mandala Model of Health was used as the framework for the study. In-depth interviews were conducted with 5 Winnipeg women living with HIV/AIDS. Data collection consisted of unstructured face-to-face interviews. An interpretive or hermeneutic method provided the basis for the data analysis. Six major themes emerged following analysis, which included health-related issues, marital/partner relationships, child and family issues, occupation, social network, and coping with the illness. These issues and concerns are not necessarily specific to women; however, women's experiences with HIV and AIDS are inseparably linked to their other experiences as women. Implications for nursing practice, education, and research were discussed. The study revealed the need to provide more knowledge-based care and support to women living with HIV/AIDS. Continuing education, increased curriculum content related to this topic, and keeping current with the latest developments in the management and treatment of HIV-AIDS are needed. Further research is necessary in all domains of women's health as it relates to HIV/AIDS.

Influence of sex on social development of captive rhesus monkeys	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						multivariate analysis; socialization processes; influence of sex; methodology; nonhuman primates	BEHAVIOR; MACAQUES; MALES	In a previous study, we demonstrated the importance of social interactions in the development of non-human primate infants. These results confirmed the social network concept. According to this concept, it is assumed that socialization processes would differ in various social environments. However, much variability remained to be explained. In the present study we investigated especially the influence of infants' gender on socialization processes. In relation to the previous results, the influence was tested within groups having the same social structure. At the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center, four mother-peer,groups of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were studied. Therefore no adult male model was available to infants. Twenty infants, including eight males, eight females and four prenatally DES-treated females, were the subjects of this study. We considered six comprehensive developmental parameters to account for the two main socialization processses, the acquisition of the social behavioral repertoire and the establishment of a network of social relationships. We analyzed the variability of these parameters using a new multivariate technique previously described in a companion paper. This new technique is derived from the Principal Components Analysis and Multivariate Analyses of Variance. The model used in this analysis included two intrinsic features of infants, sex and age and two variables related to the social organization of the groups, mother's rank and social group. This 4-variable-model significantly accounted for most of the variability of the developmental parameters. The results showed that the social group and the infant's sex were the most influential variables when infants initiated interactions: male and DES female infants displayed a greater behavioral diversity than non-treated female infants. When infants were recipients in interactions, social organization variables (social group and mother's rank, respectively) had the greatest influence on the socialization processes while infants' gender was less influential. In this case the effect of sex was confounded with the social group effect; male infants then differed from both kind of female infants in being looked at more frequently, in being contacted by a larger variety of partners and in receiving a greater variety of social behaviors. This new example of applying multivariate methods to the study of individual social development confirms the potential of this method to provide new insights into behavioral development.

Among the possible determinants examined were self-perceived literacy, access to health information, and mobility. The findings suggest that respondents receive health information from their physicians, the mass media, and members of their social networks. The results of this research also indicated that members of this population have a highly positive perception of the public library, although only a. small segment use the library regularly, and that it may be in the interest of the library to investigate the role it could play in providing health information to older adults.

EVOLUTION PSYCHIATRIQUE			French	Article						narrative; phenomenology; participatory research; agency; supported socialization	MENTAL-ILLNESS; PHENOMENOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY; SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES; SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT; DYNAMIC PSYCHIATRY; SOCIAL NETWORKS; EX-PATIENTS; COMMUNITY; REHABILITATION; DISORDER	This report suggests that one aspect of the vulnerability associated with schizophrenia is the ''dead weight'' of the socio-polrtical narrative constructions of the: self that has accrued to the status of being a mental patient within contemporary industrialized, Western cultures. These constructions paint a picture of the self of the person with schizophrenia as an empty, passive, and helpness receptacle of the actions of others. Following a review of the rise and destructive impact of this view on the person's chances for recovery, the author outlines developments in the areas of social policy, research, and clinical interventions that carve out a more active and effective role for the person with the disorder. These developments are grounded in the phenomenological and socio-political works of Husserl, Foucault, and Deleuze and Guattari, and based on a qualitative, participatory action research paradigm. Involving people with schizophrenia at all levels of these policy, research, and program development efforts ensures representation of the perspective and agency of the son with the disorder. The report concludes by arguing that the destiny of individuals with schizophrenia is tied to their pushing aside the accumulated weight of cultural misconceptions in order to resume central authority for their own lives.

Data on stress (Stress Appraisal Scale), coping strategies (Ways of Coping Questionnaire), and social network/social support (Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire) were collected from 100 persons with the primary diagnosis of IHD prior to discharge From hospital. Twenty-four persons were readmitted during the 4-month study period. The sample was divided into two groups for analysis: (1) persons with a first admission for IHD, and (2) persons with a prior history of admission for IHD. In comparison to persons with multiple admissions for cardiac illness, first time admissions appraised their IHD as less central and threatening, perceived less affective and affirmational support from health professionals, and identified health professionals less and neighbours more as sources of support. Greater use of the coping strategy 'seeking social support' was associated with the readmission of persons who had had their first admission for IHD. Less use of the coping strategy 'accepting responsibility' was associated with the readmission of persons who had a history of prior admission for IHD. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Differences in plasma fibrinogen level were investigated among middle-aged men with weak and strong structural and functional social network ties. Men with low scores in the adequacy of social participation variable (structural) had higher mean values of plasma fibrinogen than those with high scores. The difference remained after adjustment for age, smoking and cardiovascular health status and after possible modifying factors were taken into account, but did not remain significant after allowing for physical fitness. Men with high scores in overall support (functional) had higher plasma fibrinogen levels compared to the men with low scores. This difference persisted after age and cardiovascular health status were taken into account but was explained by smoking. The data suggest that smoking and cardiorespiratory fitness are important mediating or modifying factors between structural and functional aspects of social network ties and plasma fibrinogen.

The data come from a long-term follow-up of a cohort of African-American women who registered for antepartum care between September, 1967 and June, 1969. At the follow-up interview, these women were asked whether they had ever received a diagnosis of hypertension from a physician. The self-reports of hypertension were compared with information contained in the medical records of these women. Twenty five percent reported having high blood pressure but 53% of these reports were unconfirmed by their medical records (overall misreporting rates was 15.9% with 2.5%, underreporting and 13.4% overreporting). The factors related to misreporting included a psychiatric diagnosis (based on the Diagnostic Interview Schedule) of major depressive disorder or drug and/or alcohol abuse and a small social network. The conjunction of these three variables significantly affected accuracy of reporting (100% misreporting with all three variables). These results suggest that, using currently standard methodology, there is an unreliable subpopulation of respondents in health surveys that may require the collection of data on health status from a second source to confirm data from self-reported health measures.

Two hypotheses of the relationships between therapeutic connection and psychological functioning are formulated. The first predicts that higher levels of connection will be associated with greater improvement in the client's level of psychological functioning. The second predicts that higher levels of functioning at intake will, in turn, be associated with greater connection to counselor. Results from a longitudinal study of 139 participants in a federally sponsored pilot drug abuse treatment program in Houston. Texas show statistically significant associations between both a client's initial level of psychological functioning and therapeutic connection to counselor and between this connection and subsequent improvement in functioning.

Design and setting - A cohort of elderly people aged 65 years and over living in Settsu city, Osaka was followed for 38 months. Data on the history of health management, disability scores, and psychosocial conditions were collected in October 1992 by interview during home visits. Subjects - Of the 1491 people randomly selected from the computerised sex-age register at enrollment, 1473 were contacted and responses were obtained from 1405 (95.4%). They constituted the study cohort. Follow up was completed for 1325 (94.3%) (154 deceased and 1171 alive). Measurements and main results - From the analysis using the Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test, female sex, younger age group (65-74 years), use of health checks, use of basic health examination and/or cancer screening, use of daily preventive health practices, less disability, taking part in social activity, and finding life worth living were univariately statistically significantly related to survival. The estimated survival rates were highest in those with regular health checks or daily preventive health practices before 59 years of age or both basic health examination and cancer screening. From the Cox proportional hazards model, use of health checks and use of daily preventive health practices remained as statistically significant factors associated with survival, controlling for other factors such as sex, age group, medical treatment, disability scores, and psyche-social conditions, and these hazard ratios (not used v starting at 59 years) were 0.41 (95% CI, 0.25,0.66) and 0.52 (95% CI, 0.30,0.88), respectively. Conclusions - Health management efforts such as health checks and daily preventive health practices may increase survival in the elderly.

Main Outcome Measures: Frequency of students' social contacts with nondisabled peers, parent and educator social validation ratings, and participant observations, Results: The number of social contacts for each strident increased over baseline levels and was maintained over the course of the study. Parents, teachers, and students were generally satisfied with the process and with the concomitant increases in students' degree of social integration. Anecdotal follow-up reports indicated that these results were not maintained over time. Conclusions: The study's findings raise important questions about the varying perspectives on the importance of social integration, the degree to which educators can serve as change agents in students' social experiences, and the type of follow-up support required to maintain increases in students' social interactions.

We show that such policies and the institutions and social networks that promote them are locked into wider social dynamics in the political regulation of European economic and social integration and development. We argue that the 5EAP is a 'redrafting of Rio' in the context of these processes of regulation and integration rather than a systematic rearrangement of society-economy-environment relationships. These processes can be described through the three political dynamics of veto, deflection and differentiation. Focusing on the level of political dynamics provides methodological resources that can contribute to the programme of research developed by the Regulation Approach (RA) (Jessop, 1994a et passim), in particular by accounting for the conflicts and struggles between organised socio-economic actors rather than their (quasi-functionalist) cohesive structural relations that serve a dominant 'strategic line' of accumulation.

If so, is this effect modified by macroeconomic conditions or life changes such as unemployment experience, divorce or limiting illness, and it is buffered by social networks or coping behavior such as smoking? These questions are studied on a representative sample of employed people aged 20-65 who participated in the Survey of Living Conditions conducted by Statistics Sweden for the years 1980-1981 (7180 people) and 1986-1989 (13,376 people). The results reveal a conditional relationship between poverty and sleep problems. Among men it is modified, in particular, by previous experience of unemployment. Among women strong social networks buffers the effect but smoking aggravates it. Men's sleep was affected more by poverty and unemployment in the late 1980s than in the earlier period.

The aim of this paper was to determine whether there were differences in the personal networks of boys and girls, teenagers and younger children, children from different socioeconomic backgrounds and children living in different housing areas. A further aim was to see if the correlation of behavioural disturbances with aspects of personal networks differed between groups. Boys and younger children were more satisfied with their networks than girls and older children, respectively. Girls experienced greater feelings of loneliness in spite of having more friends and they were also more dependent on close contacts than boys. Older children had more social contacts than younger ones and children from lower socioeconomic groups were closer to friends, whereas children from high socioeconomic groups were closer to relatives. Children living in one-family houses experienced more conflicts between the people in their networks than children living in apartment houses. There was a stronger correlation of behavioural disturbances with aspects of personal networks for girls than for boys, for older children than for younger and for children living in apartment houses than for children living in one-family houses. There were more significant correlations of aspects of personal networks with behavioural disturbances for children from higher socioeconomic groups than for those from lower.

Although centrality is a well-studied topic in social network analysis, and is one of the most widely used properties for studying affiliation networks, virtually all discussions of centrality and centralization have concerned themselves with one-mode networks. Bonacich's work on simultaneous group and individual centralities is a notable exception (Social Networks, 1991, 13, 155-168). I begin by outlining the distinctive features of affiliation networks and describe four motivations for centrality indices in affiliation networks. I then consider properties of some existing centrality indices for affiliation networks, including the relationship between centralities for actors and events in these networks, and present a new conceptualization of centrality that builds on the formal properties of affiliation networks and captures important theoretical insights about the positions of actors and events in these networks. These centralities are then illustrated on Galaskiewicz's data on club and board memberships of a sample of corporate executive officers (Social Organization of an Urban Grants Economy. New York: Academic Press, 1985). The conclusion to this paper discusses strengths and weaknesses of centrality indices when applied to affiliation networks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

The results suggest that the culture of origin radically modulates the relationship between the pre-migration experience and the developing post-migration universe. In the case of the Central American children, the state-sponsored violence suffered in the country of origin is strongly associated with subsequent family conflicts, whereas in the case of the Southeast Asians, conflict is associated with an active social network in the community of origin, suggesting that there is;a delicate balance between the support provided and the burden imposed by the extended family.

Three characteristics of social networks were measured: availability of network resources; contact with network resources; and integration into the neighborhood. The association of social network with 5-year mortality was examined with a proportional hazards model adjusting for perceived health status, impairment in physical activities of daily living, number of chronic conditions, and years of education. Analyses were stratified by age (65-74 years, greater than or equal to 75 years). Elements of social network contact and neighborhood integration were associated with reduced mortality among women aged greater than or equal to 75 years, but not among women aged 65-74 years. In the greater than or equal to 75 years group, women who had no contact with children, friends, and group organizations showed hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals (CI)) of 3.1 (1.2-7.5), 2.2 (1.0-4.9), and 2.8 (1.2-6.5), respectively, Women who had lived less than or equal to 10 years in the neighborhood and women who had no interaction with local merchants showed hazard ratios of 2.5 (95% CI 1.3-4.8) and 2.2 (95% CI 1.2-3.9), respectively. Thus, both age and specific aspects of network structure were found to influence the association between social networks and mortality in elderly women.

Design: a structured interview survey of three samples of elderly people living at home at two points in time. The three samples comprised one census of people aged 85 and over [City (of London) and Hackney], and two random samples of people aged 65 - 84 (City and Hackney and Braintree). The follow-up interviews took place 2.5 - 3 years after the baseline interviews. Setting: City and Hackney (East London) and Braintree (Essex). Respondents were interviewed at home by one of 12 trained interviewers. Subjects: 630 people aged 85+ at baseline (70% response rate), and 78% of survivors re-interviewed at follow-up; 464 people aged 65-84 in Hackney at baseline (67% response rate), and 83% of survivors re-interviewed; 276 people aged 65-84 in Braintree at baseline (82% response rate), and 78% of survivors re-interviewed. Main outcome measures: scores on scales of functional ability, psychiatric morbidity, life satisfaction and social support, and items measuring number and type of health symptoms and services used. Conclusions: decreasing levels of physical functioning were associated with poor mental health, trouble with feet and problems with muscles and joints. There were no associations with level of physical functioning and use of rehabilitative or general medical services, use of social worker or carer relief. Few respondents used preventive or rehabilitation services.

The sample consisted of 117 persons age 55 and over (mean age = 63 years) who developed schizophrenia before age 45. With the use of bivariate analyses and then logistic regression, five variables attained significance as predictors of SWB: male gender, absence of loneliness, older age, reliable social contacts, and fewer perceived life difficulties. Although a comparison with their age-peers in the general population indicated that the sample was worse on several objective indicators of well-being, for example, income, clinical depression, physical limitations, and social network size, none of these variables wins predictive of SWB. Rather; the data largely supported the ''judgment'' theory of SWB, which proposes that SWB is based on beliefs about oneself and others.

The major theories include organisational theories of internal labor markets, career tournaments, statistical discrimination, and resource dependency; interpersonal theories of mentors, informal social networks, homophily, and politics; and individual theories of leadership traits (ambition, motivation to manage, general cognitive ability, instrumentality), human capital, managerial skills, and multiple roles. An integration is presented to show how the theories and empirical research fit together. Methodological issues in research on managerial advancement are discussed.

The canton of Vaud (600,000 inhabitants), in the south-west part of the country, counts 4 psychiatric sectors, each with a psychogeriatric service. Otherwise the canton has 146 long-stay facilities with a total of 6,000 beds, of which 600 are for psychogeriatric cases. Home care is in charge of a network of 38 medico-social centres with multidisciplinary teams including psychiatric nurses. Several nursing homes, some specialized in psychogeriatrics, are equipped, besides long-stay beds, by units for temporary care, for medico-social emergencies and for medico-social observations. Moreover, in Lausanne (250,000 inhabitants) an 'Orientation Office of Medico-Social Emergencies', with psychiatric nurses, assumes emergencies at home and by-passes hospitalizations of medico-social cases in the General Hospital, by the resource of medico-social emergency beds in the nursing homes. The medico-social network thus designed in this way is profoundly permeated with the reality of psychogeriatrics.

In a sample of over 900 children, we identified 5 distinct groups of children based on behavioral observations: Well-adjusted, undercontrolled, reserved, confident, and inhibited. At age 21, we assessed the children's interpersonal functioning in 4 social contexts: in the social network, at home, in romantic relationships, and at work. We found three patterns of relations: (a) Well-adjusted, reserved, and confident children defined a heterogeneous range of normative adult interpersonal behavior, (b) inhibited children had lower levels of social support but normative adjustment in romantic relationships and at work, and (c) undercontrolled children had lower levels of adjustment and greater interpersonal conflict across adult social contexts.

If was predicted that structurally equivalent individuals would be more likely to behave similarly (i.e., leave or stay at their position). The social influence model predicted that employees with a greater percentage of direct communication links with leavers would be more likely to leave their job. The erosion model posited that individuals located on the periphery of a social network would be more likely to leave their job or ''fall off'' the edges of the social net work. A total of 170 employees, a census of an organization, were administered a communication network questionnaire asking them to identify the people with whom they communicate at work. Network self-report data were analyzed using NEGOPY and UCINET software. Results provided support far all three models of turnover, with the erosion model explaining more of the variance than the other two models. Future research examining communication networks and employee turnover is proposed, oil the basis of these results.

The resource support model incorporates formal (institutionalized) and semi-formal (mutual aid) services along with informal assistance (social networks). Patient interview data were collected on 147 MI and 159 BY patients at hospitalization and at 3 months. Sociodemographic, illness and resource data were obtained, and hospital records were abstracted. Two outcomes were evaluated: activity limitations and work capacity. Bivariate and multivariate anlayses were used to assess individual and resource effects. Multivariate analyses revealed that, for MI patients, a higher level of activity prior to hospitalization and a shorter hospital stay were significantly related to recovery. A smaller social network with greater frequency of contact enhanced recovery. For BY patients, recovery was significantly associated with higher social class, higher level of activity prior to hospitalization and fewer health care visits. Outcome based on work capacity revealed that MI patients who were younger in age, male sex and who had fewer prescribed medications were more likely to recover. BY patients had a similar pattern as that observed for MI patients in terms of age and sex. Co-morbidity had a negative effect on recovery. Those with less affective informal support were more likely to have recovered. The resource support model employed in this prospective study proved to have mixed results.

From the late 1980s this area has gained national media attention for its lesbian population. Using a number of data sources I examine how lesbian residences and services are distributed in the Valley. I find a strong service core in the small city of Northampton, but residences, while showing some clustering around Northampton, reach well into a rural hinterland. In these rural towns lesbians live at low physical densities while forming relatively high proportions of the towns' populations. Unlike previous studies of gay male and lesbian space that have tended to focus on center cities, this paper starts to chart this space on the low-density, semirural edge of a metropolitan area. previous studies of residential concentrations of gay and lesbian persons have also found highly visible gay male territories - sometimes with a lesbian minority - but showed lesbians forming social networks or somewhat underground concentrations. Several parts of the Valley area are different; comprising a visibly lesbian space. This paper contributes to analyses of diverse populations in contemporary metropolitan and exurban regions and to discussions of methods in research on lesbian and gay populations.

Three areas of research are singled out for attention. The first consists of geographies of monetary exchange and of credit and debt which emphasizes that the history of money and of credit and debt is also geography. The second area consists of research into international financial centres, and especially the identification of social networks which play a key role in coordinating and ordering the international financial system. The third and final area of research addressed in the article studies processes of financial exclusion, and seeks to identify territories 'abandoned' by the financial system. By illustrating that the history of money and finance is also a geography, that financial institutions currently operate from well defined urban systems, and that the net result of the operations of financial institutions is to exclude many of the peoples and places of the world, we attempt to show that institutions of money and finance are at the centre of modern economic geography.

Regression analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among four types of adjustment revealed in a preceding study (''general adjustment,'' ''self-control,'' ''affiliative'' and ''dependent''), network size, demographic variables, expected social support, etc. For each adjustment type, predictive variables were identified Two of the variables that showed network effects on adjustment were Japanese language proficiency and race (Asians vs. Westerners). From these results, it would appear that social network formation does facilitate adjustment, and insight into the effect of adjustment type and demographic variables on network functions was obtained. Furthermore, the actual conditions regarding network formation of international students in japan were revealed.

The rotating credit association (RCA) typifies the process whereby supportive peer and community subgroups assist in the creation and operation of firms by providing social capital in the form of loans. One problem with the RCA as an example of social resources is that there is no solid evidence that it is a major source in financing immigrant-owned firms. This study utilizes data from the U.S. Bureau of the Census to analyze sources and amounts of start-up capital that financed small business creation for immigrant Koreans and Chinese. Data self-reported by over 2, 000 Korean/Chinese who opened new firms during 1979-1987 are analyzed and compared with start-up statistics for nonminorities and Asian Americans who are not immigrants. The majority of start-up capital that financed small business formation came from family wealth (equity) and financial institution loans (debt). These financing patterns typified all groups. High levels of start-up capital typify Korean/Chinese immigrant-owned firms reflecting their heavy reliance upon equity capital to finance small business creation. If no loan finds were forthcoming from friends, rotating credit associations, associates, family and other secondary debt sources, the average Korean/Chinese start-up would nonetheless possess substantially more financial capital than its nonminority cohort. Looking solely at firms utilizing loan funds to finance business creation, Korean/Chinese borrowers had lower mean loan sizes and lower debt to equity ratios than the comparison group firms: the aggregate debt to equity ratios for nonminorities and Chinese/Korean immigrants were 2.75 and 1.18, respectively. Among the borrowing firms, financial institutions skim off the most attractive Korean/Chinese borrowers, mostly college graduates who invest substantial sums of equity capital into their start-ups. The nonbank borrowers-particularly those borrowing from friends-were most disadvantaged, relative to nonminority small business owners. Controlling for firm and owner characteristics statistically the Korean/Chinese start-ups borrowing from friends and family Ir ere found to be penalized by over $25,000 in loan size, relative to nonminorities, whereas Asian nonimmigrant borrowers incurred no such penalty. Prevailing scholarly literature misinterprets the realities of how Korean and Chinese immigrant entrepreneur finance entry into small businesses. These firms stand out for their particularly heavy reliance upon family wealth. Nontraditional debt capital sources are of secondary importance, and they are utilized more by the weaker start-ups.

Increased distress was reported by permanently relocated men, while those who were evacuated, but returned to their original homes, reported distress levels comparable to their nonevacuated coworkers. Additionally, among evacuated men, only those whose relocation placed them at an increased distance from family and/or friends reported distress levels higher than the nonevacuated. Change in visiting frequency with family and/or friends following evacuation was not related to distress. Although these data are correlational and cross-sectional, they are consistent with the hypothesis that disaster related distress is, in part, a function of resulting social network disruption.

In multiple regression analyses controlling for acute stress, Social Support coping explained 10% of the variance in Intrusion. Distancing and Anger coping explained 7% and 6%, respectively, of the variance in Avoidance. Positive Reappraisal coping explained 8% of psychosomatic symptom variance. Brief Symptom Inventory distress scores were related positively to Anger coping and negatively to social network involvement (12% and 13%, respectively, of unique variance). Results highlight the importance of examining coping strategies in relation to specific distress symptoms.

Nevertheless, there is still a lack of reliable theoretical and empirical concepts of measuring social influence. For analysis of the interpersonal influence the present study combines two different approaches (concept of ego-centered networks and the theory of planned behavior by Ajzen/Fishbein). The study uses a questionnaire with 367 responses from German users and non-users of computer networks. The results point to social networks as a crucial determinant of innovation-decisions, especially in the case of the diffusion of modern communication technology. Not only in the personal core network have early adopters many relations with people who have already adopted the innovation, but also outside of it. In many cases these relations can actually be described as homogeneous, but also as ''weak ties''. The ''innovator's-network'' does not only form a pro-innovative background, but it also turns out to be a source of social influence or social pressure urging others to adopt the innovation.

Recordings of 81 speakers from across the Fens were analyzed for the use of (ai), a particularly salient local variable. A ''Canadian Raising'' type of allophonic variation was found in the central Fenland: speakers in this area used raised onsets of (ai) before voiceless consonants but open onsets before voiced consonants, morpheme boundaries, and /(sic)/. The article weighs a number of possible explanations for the emergence of this variation in the Fens. Based on compelling evidence from the demographic history of the area, it supports a view that such an allophonic distribution, previously thought not to be found in Britain, emerged as the result of dialect contact. The sociolinguistic process. of koineization that is commonly associated with post-contact speech communities (Trudgill 1986) is held responsible for the focusing of this allophonic variation from the input dialects of an initially mixed variety. The article concludes by suggesting a socially based explanatory model to account for the way that speakers implement processes of focusing and koineization in areas of dialect contact.

Although these institutions are widespread, there are hardly any empirical studies on the characteristics of their users or on their effects. In this study, 100 patients in TSn and KBSn in Berlin were examined. Social characteristics, psychopathology and attitudes of the patients were investigated. Almost all patients had been in psychiatric hospitals before. The current psychopathology varied greatly and was moderate on average. Two-thirds of the patients were pensioners, most of them living alone with just a few or no friends. Contact with other people and structured day activities were most often mentioned as positive aspects by the patients. The most frequent negative aspect was annoyance by fellow users. Patients in TSn were significantly younger and had higher scores on BPRS subscale anergia. In other variables, there was little difference between patients in the two institutions. The results suggest that both institutions - as intended - care for chronic mentally ill patients with poor social integration. For these patients they provide some compensations for a insufficient social network. Limitations and consequences of the findings are briefly discussed.

The paper demonstrates, in the case of biotechnology start-ups, that network formation and industry growth are significantly influenced by the development and nurturing of social capital. The paper raises several important implications: structural hole theory may apply more to networks of market transactions than to networks of cooperative relationships, and that the study of the structure of interfirm collaborations over time requires an analysis of the network as a whole.

These alternative explanations are evaluated using Canadian national election data. The analysis reinforces previous research asserting the importance of registration barriers in reducing the turnout of those who have recently moved. Additionally, I find that movers' social ties play an independent role in their turnout, with moving particularly attenuating unmarried citizens' turnout. These findings are extended to suggest that recent U.S. initiatives facilitating voter registration may produce less than previously predicted turnout gains among the mobile.

A. Kenny, 1994). This article develops an analogous model for triadic data. This triadic relations model, a 3-way random-effects analysis of variance, can estimate 7 variances and 16 covariances from a round-robin of 3-person interactions. This article applies this model to perceptions of liking among 72 college-student acquaintances. These variance-components methods could also be used to study cognitive balance, social networks, social perception, and group performance.

The culturally unique representative sample consisted of 3,777 noninstitutionalized older persons living in southwestern France. The findings indicated that French older adults generally had more than 8 people in their networks, their networks consisted mostly of family members, and they felt understood by most of their network members. These older adults reported being satisfied with their social relations. Sociodemographic variables contribute (R(2) = .143) to depressive symptomatology, as did social network (incremented R(2) = .033) and social support (incremented R(2) = .09) variables. Sociodemographic, social network, and social support variables together increased the variance explained still further (incremented R(2) = .108). Results were consistent with similar analyses in the U.S. and indicated that social support variables account for more variance in depressive symptomatology than social network variables.

Two Swiss initiatives which developed highly energy-efficient means of individual transport in the past ten years are analyzed in terms of the resources they could mobilize and the risks they run. To assess the milieu's potential for radical innovation, we examine the construction of a lightweight safety system, the social construction of the product category ''lightweight vehicle,'' and the (mis)management of the interface between prototype development and large-scale manufacturing.

However, research and practice in applied sport psychology have shown only marginal concern for the social dimensions of participation. As a consequence of stronger ties to clinical and counseling psychology than to social psychology, the prevailing model of intervention in applied sport psychology has been individually centered. Focus at the individual level has been further bolstered by cognitive emphases in modern psychology. The purpose of this paper is tb highlight the need for a balanced consideration of social and personal influences. Four social psychological dimensions of interest will be explored, including athletic subculture membership; athletic identity concerns; social networks of influence; and leadership processes. The relevance of these forms of influence will be examined in relation to applied concerns in the areas of athlete academic performance, overtraining and burnout, and disordered eating patterns. At minimum, consultants need to address contextual and relational correlates of psychological and performance issues.

This 1-year longitudinal study examined such effects in a sample of 2,337 male substance abuse inpatients, 57.7% of whom became significantly involved in 12-step activities (e.g., reading program literature, attending meetings) after treatment. An a priori model of the interplay of 12-step involvement and friendship networks was tested using structural equation modeling, and found to have excellent fit to the data. Twelve-step group involvement after treatment predicted better general friendship characteristics (e.g., number of close friends) and substance abuse-specific friendship characteristics (e.g., proportion of friends who abstain front drugs and alcohol) at follow-up. Results are discussed in terms of how mutual help group involvement benefits patients and how the self-help group evaluation paradigm should be broadened.

To identify risk and protective factors for family homelessness, a case-control study of homeless and low-income, never-homeless families, all female-headed, was conducted. Methods. Homeless mothers (n = 220) were enrolled from family shelters in Worcester, Mass. Low-income housed mothers receiving welfare (n = 216) formed the comparison group. The women completed an interview covering socioeconomic, social support, victimization, mental health, substance use, and health domains. Results. Childhood predictors of family homelessness included foster care placement and respondent's mother's use of drugs. Independent risk factors in adulthood included minority status, recent move to Worcester, recent eviction, interpersonal conflict, frequent alcohol or heroin use, and recent hospitalization for a mental health problem. Protective factors included being a primary tenant, receiving cash assistance or a housing subsidy, graduating from high school, and having a larger social network. Conclusions. Factors that compromise an individual's economic and social resources are associated with greater risk of losing one's home.

We show that the search for balance in social interaction among interdependent actors can yield a cascade of activism and result in a successful social movement. The characteristics of actors critical for movement success are identified. We also explore the structural conditions underlying a successful cascade of activism and thus identify the social dynamics of and the structural conditions for collective action in human society.

Changes in maternal behaviour, infants' social milieux and infants' social networks were examined as a function of changes in group size and composition among free-ranging rhesus monkeys, Macaca mulatta, on Cayo Santiago, Puerto Rico. Data were analysed for 10 group-years collected between 1974 and 1990 representing a single social group during periods of rapid expansion and fissioning, two daughter groups following fissioning and an unrelated group that did not undergo fissioning. As group size expanded, infants found themselves near (<5 m) larger numbers of group members and smaller proportions of close kin. Mothers spent more time near their infants and sought more proximity with them. Infants developed social networks that were more highly kin biased. When the groups fissioned, these trends reversed. Significant correlations were found between group size, mother-infant interaction and infant social networks across all group-years. Individual variation in the degree to which infant social networks were kin biased was related both directly to the infant's social milieu and indirectly to its relationship with its mother. Given the long-term nature of the mother's influence on social networks, these results suggest that demographic influences on developmental processes can lead to progressive changes in social structure in the absence of resource scarcity.

Social support has been found to be associated with health behaviors. Although a woman's health may benefit from supportive relationships, the effect of diminished social networks on practices of BSE among older women has not been examined. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between social support and the frequency and accuracy of BSE practice. The sample consisted of 22 women, 55 years of age and older who were having routine examinations at a small Midwestern gynecologic clinic. Social support was assessed by the Norbeck Social Support Questionnaire, and two tools assessed the accuracy and frequency of BSE. Social support was found to be significantly related to the frequency of BSE (r = 0.45, p < 0.05), but not to the accuracy of BSE (r = 0.28). The results also indicated that these women had lower social support scores compared with younger women. Planners of nursing intervention for BSE should consider healthcare providers as important resources in social support networks for the reinforcement of frequency and accuracy of BSE for older women.

The women suffer from a lack of self-esteem, guilt, shame and powerlessness. Broken relationships, a tendency to confirm with drinking partners, sexual problems and sexual abuse were all found to be important reasons for female abusers' drinking. Drinking to reduce stress, to relax, or for the intoxicating effect were also significant factors in the women's drinking patterns. Emotional problems relating to the women themselves were stronger incentives for change than social problems. The results suggest that therapeutic intervention for women must focus on raising self-esteem, solving emotional problems and managing stress.

Men are more likely to he sexually active, but less apt than women to be satisfied with their level of sexual activity. Regarding predictors of sexual activity, for men the strongest predictors were being younger and having more education. For women, the strongest predictor by far was being married. For both men and women the strongest predictors for satisfaction were being sexually active and having positive mental health scores. In summary, the main variables predicting sexual activity were being married, having more education, being younger, being male, and having good social networks. The main predictors for satisfaction with sexual activity were, in addition to being sexually active, being female, having good mental health, and better functional status.

Several authors have commented approvingly on this move, including Putnam and Stohl (1990), who admonish researchers to look to bona fide groups, those characterized by ''stable yet permeable boundaries'' and ''interdependence with context'' as they leave the laboratory and enter field settings. This essay seeks to specify in detail what the operationalization of the concept of a bona fide group might involve; applies those operational concepts to surgical teams; and discusses theoretical, methodological, and research implications of this effort. We observe that operationalizing ''stable yet permeable boundaries'' and ''interdependence with context'' requires conceptual steps not fully articulated in the original description of bonafide groups. Building on the arguments that Putnam and Stohl have set forth, we argue that further study of ''bona fide'' groups will usefully include: 1) attention to group process in context; 2) connectivity using network analytic constructs; 3) membership pools as sources of group membership; and 4) the institutional environments of groups as a critical component of ''context.'' In turn, we treat the implications of this argument for researchers and practitioners.		Lammers, JC (reprint author), UNIV CALIF SANTA BARBARA,DEPT COMMUN,SANTA BARBARA,CA 93106, USA.

I use a modified version of Roy's model of occupational choice which allows for the existence of costs of entry into craft occupations. Data from a 1988 survey of construction workers are used to estimate the model and test for rationing. The results confirm the existence of rationing according to a worker's regional background, but are inconclusive with respect to kinship ties and social networks.

Low support showed some consistency across members of the nuclear family but was fairly specific for particular network members outside of the family. Children with low support from their mother, father or classmates reported a low general self-worth, but those with low support from siblings or nonschool peers did not. Low support by one parent could only be compensated for by a supportive relationship with the other parent. Low support by a classmate was not compensated by supportive siblings or nonschool peers. These findings underscore the relationship specificity of social support and of its relation to self-esteem in preadolescence.

Rejected children, relative to other children, were perceived as higher both in aggression and in being victimized (both physically and verbally) and had the smallest number of mutual friends. In addition, the mutual friends of rejected status boys were perceived as higher in being victimized than were the friends of other children. Neither level of aggression nor level of victimization predicted number of mutual friendships. However, significant positive correlations for both aggressive and victimization behaviors were revealed between popular and average status children and their mutual friends, and these congruences were not found between rejected status children and their mutual friends. This research highlights the complexity and importance of evaluating the form and function of social behaviors within multiple levels of children's peer social relationships.

At both times of measurement, respondents delineated significantly larger networks using the SNL than using the SSQ, with a larger average number of friends being elicited by the SNL. Respondents averaged significantly higher global network satisfaction ratings for SSQ networks relative to SNL networks at both times of measurement. More of the same individual network members' names were repeated at the second time of measurement and more new network members were added at the second time of measurement on the SNL than on the SSQ. Implications for network research are discussed.

Caregivers' perceptions of support from family and friends have been linked to their health status (R. Kahn & T. Antonucci, 1980; I. Sandler & M. Barrera, 1984). The purpose of this study was to explore the social networks and types of perceived support described by women who are caregivers of cognitively impaired older adults. Content analysis was used to examine interview data from a longitudinal qualitative study of 20 women caregivers of cognitively impaired older persons. An important finding of this study was the identification of a typology of social networks of the women caregivers. The caregivers' perceptions of satisfaction with support received and experience of conflict with network members varied according to the characteristics of their social network. Those caregivers who belonged to diverse social networks reported high satisfaction with the support that they received and little or no conflict. Those caregivers with kin-dominated social networks reported little satisfaction with support received and a high degree of conflict.

It illustrates how utility, strategy and c-games, concepts found in game theory, could be used by exchange theorists to help them reflect on their models and improve their research design. One game theoretic solution concept, the kernel, is compared to recent network exchange algorithms as an illustration of how easy it is to apply game theory to the exchange network situation.

Willer and Skvoretz offer a method for conceptualizing the micro-processes of network exchange theory in game theoretic terms, and conduct empirical tests of the resulting new formulation. Bienenstock and Bonacich make explicit attempts to supplant network exchange formulations with game theory, revealing what they consider to be fatal weaknesses in the former and remedies in the latter. A thread that wends through both works is the desirability of understanding thoroughly how a micro-level phenomenon-choice-and a macro-level phenomenon-network-integrate to produce phenomena that do not exist outside the confluence of the two. After a brief examination of the terminological question 'To what does the label ''network exchange theory'' refer?', I address it series of key issues in each of the articles.

A pre-intervention study was conducted to determine how to successfully carry out a possible future intervention to reduce HIV risk among adolescents in urban Zambia. Ethnographic and sexual data were collected on 276 males and females both attending and not attending secondary school during a 14-month period in 1992-1993. Additionally, several focus groups were conducted. This paper reviews the cultural background of Zambian adolescents and presents an overview of the study results. Among the findings, it was learned that most of the male and female adolescents (average age of 17) are sexually active, very few routinely use condoms, less than half of sexually active adolescents have ever used a condom, AIDS is omnipresent in Zambia, the threat of HIV infection is a very real concern for most of the adolescents, there is a strong desire to protect themselves from HIV infection during sex (but condoms are often seen as ineffective and other forms of safer sex are not discussed), nearly all of the sexually active females and some of the males have received money or gifts for sex, and some of the out-of-school females are engaging in very risky sex (e.g., unprotected anal intercourse, and anilingus) with adult men. The ethnographic data, including a brief trial risk reduction workshop, suggests that the core values and social norms of the adolescents may shape behavioral change. A value utilization/norm change (VUNC) model is developed, which is intended to provide a conceptual framework for understanding how to utilize selected core values of the adolescents to strengthen or alter norms within the social networks in order to elicit desired HIV risk reduction.

The data were collected via interviews with 15 people collaborating on two programmes: screening of colorectal cancer using the Hemoccult II(R) test in France, and restructuring health services in a district in Guinea. The results stress that a public and community health programme can be described as a self-organizing, dynamic, observing and observed system. With a systemic approach, a programme can be modelled according to three steps. First, preliminaries: although initially motivated by the wish to improve the system, the intervention on it meets with resistance to any change. This stage proposes to open an ''intervention space'' including the definition of an appropriate framework, and the modelling of the problematic situation. Second, change: this stage brings new standards in the system. The more useful, the more suited to the mind of the collaborators and the more integrated into the existing social networks, the more easily the changes are welcomed. Finally, autonomization: the regulations of the system contribute to maintain the new standards, and thus to strengthen the changes. In conclusion, in the initial purpose to improve its operational capabilities, an intervention on a local part of the social and health system may, on the contrary, cause troubles. The systemic approach proposes a scenario in order to deal with this complexity. It also gives new insights for planning, implementing, and assessing health programmes.

Crime statistics, anecdotal evidence and drug treatment reports indicate that crack-cocaine use has emerged as a significant social phenomenon in Alabama. The increase in pediatric and heterosexually-transmitted HIV/AIDS among African-Americans in Alabama suggests that the increase in crack-cocaine use and HIV/AIDS may be linked. This study sought to investigate the link between crack-cocaine use and HIV transmission in a small group of incarcerated Alabama women jailed for illicit drug use or drug-related crimes. The study was organized into focus group interviews consisting of three to six women (total eighteen), who discussed the topics of drug use, initiation and distribution, sexual activity, condom use and social networks in audiotaped sessions. The ratio of African-American to Caucasian women was 3:1, with ages ranging from to eighteen to fifty-three years. The use of crack-cocaine was said to be prompted by male intimates, with co-factors such as 'rite of passage' (African-American women) and 'life trauma' (Caucasian women) also reported. While drug distribution networks were primarily the domain of men, women reported being given more or better quality crack-cocaine, and being assigned the role of purchaser for male friends and partners. Sexual exchange or barter was commonplace; however, condom use was sporadic or the prerogative of men. While condoms were most often used in sexual activity with strangers, they were rarely used in sex with friends or regular partners. Social networks consisted primarily of male intimates and men identified as 'drug buddies'. Relationships between women were frankly distrustful, and few subjects cited women as their friends. Relationships with family members were likely to be strained or fractured, with fathers reported as being absent or dead. The frequently cited finding that women who use crack-cocaine risk HIV transmission through unprotected sexual exchange is confirmed in this study. A broader investigation into the HIV-related risks associated with crack-cocaine use is recommended for both men and women in Alabama.

Working as part of a community-negotiating and building partnerships with families, social networks, and organizations to change problematic patterns and mobilize resources-requires not only collaboration among administrators, but teamwork among front line staff. Team members need to share work; knowledge, and resources, while building collaborative relationships with their counterparts in other organizations, service users, and other residents. Ensuring congruence between new, integrative methods of practice and the way they are introduced and managed may require substantial changes in management behavior. "Resistance" is best understood in this context as feedback to management about its need to change.

Eight-and 11-year-olds evaluated two hypothetical target children in three scenarios which differed as to the intent of a provocative act (Accidental, Ambiguous, Hostile). In addition to grade and sex, relationship between targets was manipulated as a between-subjects variable with targets portrayed as either Best Friends Acquaintances, or Enemies. Children evaluated targets in terms of attributions of intentions, behavior response, affective state of targets, and mutual liking between targets. Results indicated that aggressor's intentions and victim's behavior response were evaluated as positive for the Accidental scenario and as negative for the Hostile scenario regardless of target relationship. When aggressor's intentions were unclear (e.g., Ambiguous), interactions between Best Friends and interactions between Acquaintances were evaluated as positive while interactions between Enemies were perceived as negative. Further, while all children predicted a negative response by the victim during the Hostile situation, younger children predicted the victim's response would be less negative than did older children. Children reported Best Friends and Acquaintances as liking each other more before the provocation situation started than after it occurred while liking between Enemies remained unchanged, thus indicating a belief that provocations may hurt a positive or neutral relationship. Targets were perceived to be in negative affective states during the Accidental and Ambiguous scenarios and the aggressor was perceived to be in a neutral affective state during the Hostile scenario. Results are discussed in terms of previous research on response to provocation and implications for research on children's peer conflicts. (C) 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The impact of individual perceptions on health is well-established. However, no valid ann reliable measure of individual wellness perceptions exists. Therefore, the purpose was to introduce a measure called the Perceived Wellness Survey (PWS). Design. Convenience sampling facilitated recruitment of a sample large enough to perform factor analysis with adequate power (.85). The appropriateness of factor analysis is supported by Bartlett's test (chi(2) = 7110, p less than or equal to .01) and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy (.91). Setting. The sample (n = 558) was composed of 3M Inc. employees from multiple sites in Austin, Texas (n = 393); employees from MuRata Electronics, Inc., College Station, Pennsylvania (n = 53); and students enrolled at the University of Texas at Austin (n = 112). Subjects. Racial, gender, and age distribution was, respectively, 6.3% African-American (n = 35), 8.2% Asian (n = 46), 73.3% Caucasian (n = 409), 9.5% Hispanic (n = 53), and 2.7% other (n = 15); 47.8% male (n = 267), and 52.2% female (n = 291); and 36.8 years. Measures. Measures included the Perceived Wellness Survey, and two additional versions of the Perceived Wellness Survey designed to measure both discriminant and face validity. Perceived Wellness Survey subscales include physical, spiritual, intellectual, psychological, social, and emotional dimensions. Results. All subscales were correlated (p less than or equal to .05) with the Perceived Wellness Survey composite and with each other. Evidence of internal consistency (alpha = .88 to .93), and discriminant, face, and factorial validity was provided. Finally, the Perceived Wellness Survey appears to be a unidimensional scale. Conclusion. The unidimensional nature of the Perceived Wellness Survey suggests that perceptions of wellness in various dimensions are intertwined by their affective nature. The Perceived Wellness Survey appears to be reasonably valid and reliable; however, further research is needed.

The implications of this idea become apparent when the approaches taken by Michael Waiter and Pierre Bourdieu are interpreted and compared. Waiter described the intellectual practice as a critical interpretation of cultural schemata and value models. This description, however, still reflects normative assumptions and a one-sided phenomenological bias towards the outstanding personal traits of intellectuals. In contrast, Bourdieu seeks to understand intellectuals and their actions by examining the structural conditions of the intellectual field of which they were a part. After looking at these concepts it is possible, considering the ambivalence between cultural autonomy and political activism, to draw a clear line between the creators of culture in general and intellectuals in particular. As members of the intelligentsia, writers, artists, etc. can be labelled critical intellectuals only when they use their symbolic authority and legitimacy to become actively involved in the political field. In conclusion, Hillmann identifies the cultural schemata, social networks and cultural organizations as the essential cognitive, communicative and institutional resources on which intellectuals find support for their symbolic strategies and political involvement.
