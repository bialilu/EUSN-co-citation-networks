The reliability and both the convergent and discriminant validity of these scales were tested in 5 samples of adults by network questionnaires, interaction diaries, and personality scales. The results indicate (a) sufficient reliability and independence, thus -because of their briefness -high efficiency of the scales, (b) high relationship-specificity, and (c) good convergent and discriminant validity of the scales with regard to different relationship qualities.

Two studies are reported to explore these topics. Concerning the sources of social support these studies found that their relevance greatly depends on the contexts studied. The selection of supporters is controlled by the specific coping - and problem-solving-need released by the the stressor, the familiarity of the supporters with the stressor, the closeness of the supporters with the supportee and their similarity in personal characteristics. Ego-and self-threatening kinds of stress strongly set off the need for very close and intimate supporters. Concerning the modes of support the studies found that the support needed is closely related to the amount and kind of stress experienced. For major ego-and self-threatening stressors receiving psychological support becomes critical for the maintainance of psychological health. For coping with minor stressors instrumental support is also important.

Patients (N=248) undergoing heart surgery were surveyed once before and twice after surgery. Study 1 examined whether presurgical personal and social resources would predict quality of life one week after heart surgery. Synergistic affects emerged upon degree of worry and mental activity as quality of life indicators. Study 2 examined resources of social network members. A sample of 114 significant others, most of them spouses, reported about their own resources at Time 1. The patient-spouse dyad was chosen as the unit of analysis. Spouses' optimistic self-beliefs and social support as measured at Time 1 predicted patients' quality of life after half a year (Time 3). The results are discussed in terms of the ''resource transfer'' within dyads in time of stress.		Schwarzer, R (reprint author), FREE UNIV BERLIN,HABELSCHWERDTER ALLEE 45,D-14195 BERLIN,GERMANY.

Both areas have gone through a process of severe de-industrialization and deep social change, accompanied by significant political developments. The article examines the effects these changes have had upon the two localities, both from the point of view of social identities and of the role and orientations of local political actors. Research findings in both towns indicate that there is a congruence between underlying social identities and the specific solutions attempted by the main political actors to deal with de-industrialization. In Sesto, the Communist Party and the left-dominated council have reacted to a weakening of the communist subculture by shedding their traditional proletarian image. They are keen to promote the development of small-scale industry, relying on the resilience and vitality of the family and social networks. In Venissieux the social situation is closer to 'anomie', while the left subculture is closing ranks and adopting a defensive stance. The local council relies on central government for large-scale schemes of urban regeneration. Nation-specific patterns of political behaviour and socioeconomic development prevail over cross-national similarities. A common phase - as urban conurbations dominated by a small number of large corporations and as centres of trade-union militancy and communist culture - has given way to contrasting scenarios.

Methods are suggested for estimating the size of such networks, using known rates of mobility together with survey data on the number of acquaintances of individuals who have recently moved. Special attention is given to the likely correlation between mobility rates and network size. Estimates are found to be consistent with previous estimates in, the literature. The relation of this approach to multiplicity sampling and to ''the small-world problem'' is also discussed.		Rogerson, PA (reprint author), SUNY BUFFALO, BUFFALO, NY 14260 USA.

Method: Social support was measured using the Significant Others Scale for 44 patients with AN, 81 patients with BN, and 86 polytechnic students. Results: Earing disorder patients had smaller social networks than the students. AN patients were significantly less likely than BN patients to have a spouse or partner as a support figure. Both AN and BN patients reported less actual emotional and practical support than students. AN patients perceived their social support to be adequate, whereas BN patients were dissatisfied with their support. Patients set lower ideals for support than the students. Social support was not correlated with duration of illness. Discussion: AN and BN patients ha ve deficient social networks. In BN patients there is disturbance in both the size and perceived adequacy of social relationships. (C) 1997 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Method: Observational cross-sectional analysis of 414 primary care patients in a rural community health center and 125 ESRD patients requiring hemodialysis in two community dialysis units. The Duke Health Profile (DUKE) anxiety-depression scale was used to assess mental health; the DUKE disability scale, to indicate disablement; the Duke Social Support and Stress Scale, to measure support and stress; and the Duke Severity of illness Scale, to rate severity of illness. Results: Perceived current mental health in terms of anxiety and depression symptoms was worse for primary care than for ESRD patients, and perceived current disablement was no different for the two groups. Patients' perception of their health status and of stress from family members were more closely associated with their level of anxiety and depression symptoms than were their diagnostic profiles or overall severity of illness. in turn, their level of anxiety and depression symptoms was the principal correlate of their disablement. Conclusions: The demonstration of strong relationships among anxiety and depression symptoms, disablement, and family stress in these two very different patient populations should stimulate further research and motivate clinicians to evaluate all three parameters as part of routine patient care.

Religious coping is defined as the extent to which persons use religious beliefs and practices to help them to cope. Method: This is a cross-sectional cohort study conducted in a 120 bed VA-affiliated and a 125 bed university-affiliated community-based nursing home in Durham, North Carolina. Participants were 115 chronic care nursing home residents mean age of the sample was seventy-nine years, 44 percent were women, and 17 percent were African Americans. Subjects were enrolled for a one-month period during which comprehensive psychosocial and health assessments were performed, including evaluation of cognitive function (Mini-Mental State Exam), physical function (Barthel index), severity of medical comorbidity (Cumulative illness Rating Scale), self-reported physical pain (vertical verbal descriptor scale), depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), social support (social network), and religious coping (Religious Coping Index). Results: Over 43 percent of the sample scored in the depressed range of the Geriatric Depression Scale. Almost 60 percent reported they used religion at least to a large extent when coping with their problems; 34 percent said that it was the most important factor that enabled them to cope. Patients who used religion to cope had greater social support (p =.01), more severe medical. illness (p =.04), and better cognitive functioning (p =.02). Conclusions: Religious beliefs and practices are frequently used by chronically institutionalized older adults to help them to cope. Religious coping is associated with more severe medical illness, higher social support, and better cognitive functioning.

We try to answer two questions: How are statements about social problems constructed? What are the citizens of St Petersburg referring to when they talk about social problems? Our material consists of loosely structured thematic interviews with 42 families in St Petersburg in 1993. The interviews were part of a joint Finnish-Russian study on living conditions, survival strategies, social problems and social networks in Russia. The title of our paper comes from the somewhat surprising observation that dirt and disorder in everyday life were the most frequently mentioned social problems. These and other statements made about social problems in present-day Russia are taken as examples of social constructs and it is argued that these privately produced claims should be conceived as part of the public claims-making process within the constructionist tradition. Instead of the traditional four-field (private/public intersecting with the symbolic/practical) scheme, however, we suggest a more complex 'hexagon' scheme, in order to emphasize that the speaker as a subject employs multiple identities (various conceptions of 'me' and 'us') simultaneously. The hexagon model enables us to analyse the scattered references to dirt in a unifying framework of concepts. In answer to the question of why dirt is perceived to be such an important social problem for the citizens of St Petersburg it is concluded that dirt (like other identified social problems) is a multidimensional phenomenon that refers on a practical and symbolic level to a variety of larger concerns.

A positive relationship between social support and health is generally accepted in the literature. However, the set of dimensions used to define social support is inconsistent. In addition, few measurement tools have established reliability and validity. Findings from this conceptual analysis suggested four of the most frequently used defining attributes of social support: emotional, instrumental, informational, and appraisal. Social network, social embeddedness, and social climate were identified as antecedents of social support, Social support consequences were subsumed under the general rubric of positive health states. Examples were personal competence, health maintenance behaviours, effective coping behaviours, perceived control, sense of stability, recognition of self-worth, positive affect, psychological well-being, and decreased anxiety and depression. Recommendations for future research were made.

The model assumes that the vertices of the graph are partitioned into two unknown blocks and that the probability of an edge between two vertices depends only on the blocks to which they belong. Statistical procedures are derived for estimating the probabilities of edges and for predicting the block structure from observations of the edge pattern only. ML estimators can be computed using the EM algorithm, but this strategy is practical only for small graphs. A Bayesian estimator, based on Gibbs sampling, is proposed. This estimator is practical also for large graphs. When ML estimators are used, the block structure can be predicted based on predictive likelihood. When Gibbs sampling is used, the block structure can be predicted from posterior predictive probabilities. A side result is that when the number of vertices tends to infinity while the probabilities remain constant, the block structure can be recovered correctly with probability tending to 1.

Such views are sometimes reflected in the nature of programs and services, and the more limited expectations that service providers hold about older people. This paper reports on the findings of a qualitative study of the later life experiences of 62 older people (over 55 years) with intellectual disability. Contrary to the often negative stereotypes, in later life, many of this group experienced considerable personal growth, broadened their horizons and increased their personal autonomy and independence. However, for them, later life was also a time of increased vulnerability to inappropriate residential environments, residential mobility, loss and disruption of social networks and reduced access to specialist disability services. Conclusions are drawn about the ways in which later life opportunities can be safeguarded and vulnerabilities reduced through the development of appropriate policies and services for older people with intellectual disability.

This paper presents a statistical model based on cultural consensus analysis for aggregating these separate digraphs into a single consensus digraph. In addition, the model allows estimation of separate hit and false alarm rates for each actor that can vary within each actor in different regions of the digraph. Several standard signal detection models are used to interpret the hit and false alarm parameters in terms of knowledge and response bias. A published three-way data set by Kumbasar, Romney, and Batchelder (American Journal of Sociology, 1994) is analyzed, and the model reveals that both response bias and knowledge decrease with distance from ego.

We treat these categories as an Event Frame that can be applied sociologically in several ways. Using the frame theoretically, we suggest how people bring determinacy, purposefulness, and mobilizability to events, and thereby event sequences emerge that serve as ''macroactions'' -productive routines conducted in social establishments, and used as purposeful actions by individuals. Employing a computer program to implement the Event Frame and facilitate data management, we show that the frame can be a basis for coding a narrative about organizational happenings into a sequence of well-defined events. Making use of the analytic capabilities of the same computer program, we illustrate how social networks can be extracted from events data as a basis for multi-faceted views of organizational and inter-organizational structure.

By ''controversial'', I mean an innovation whose value (and subsequent adoption) is socially determined and not rationally determined - that is, there is no exogenous superior or inferior quality to the innovation that determines its eventual adoption. The purpose of this paper is to model the conditions under which the innovation may come to dominate the organization. The results parallel those of Boorman and Levitt's: (1) In a large undifferentiated organization, no controversial innovation can survive unless it begins with a large proportion of believers in the innovation. (2) However, there are structural conditions under which even a very small minority of innovators can take over a large organization. Contrary to intuition and some of the literature on innovation, these conditions that lead to unexpected innovative adoptions are enhanced by the organization's viscosity, that is, the lack of free movement and exchange of ideas and people throughout the organization.

Little research, however, has addressed the question of how to predict high performance from individuals who are placed on teams. Sociometry can provide an alternative to previous methods by measuring preferred pairings among team members across a number of tasks or settings. The choices given and received among members within a social network can reveal the degree of mutual preference for working together, and is referred to as the group's density. In this study, the survey method was used to measure 29 squads at a military college for their density as well as for the level of satisfaction and perceived cohesion among team members. Sociometric strong or dense teams were found to perform better across a combination of several different criterion measures. Implications for future research and applied uses in organizations are discussed.		Lucius, RH (reprint author), UNIV GEORGIA,DEPT PSYCHOL,ATHENS,GA 30602, USA.

In general, they concluded that psychosocial interventions are most effective in the early stages of disease, the strongest predictors of survival are biological, the effects of psychological factors on survival are inconsistent in early stage disease and insignificant in cases of metastatic cancer, sociodemographic variables (high socioeconomic status, private health insurance, and involvement in social networks) are positively correlated with survival, and psychosocial factors are more apparent in patients younger than 55 years.

The sample was 13- to 15-year-old Zimbabwean adolescents residing in traditional extended families and modified extended families (N = 128). The instrument used in the investigation was the Network of Relationships Inventory. A repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance was conducted with sex (boys vs. girls) and type of extended family (modified vs. traditional) treated as between-group factors and type of relationship (mother, father, favorite other adult relative, teacher, best friend, and favorite sibling) as a within-subjects factor. Adolescents in traditional extended families perceived themselves as receiving higher levels of intimacy from their family and conflict/discipline from all members of their social network in comparison to their counterparts living in modified extended families. In contrast, participants in modified extended families rated nonfamily targets higher on intimacy and mother, father, other adult relative, and best friend higher on the support variate of reliable affection than did their counterparts. Although participants were embedded in extended families in their daily lives, mothers and fathers still had salient roles. Peers were of importance for intimacy and companionship. Extended families, regardless of type, provided extensive affect and instrumental support for adolescents within family settings.

Early attachment information was available for all participants. Counselors rated them on several personal and interpersonal characteristics after the reunion, including social competence. The participants were also interviewed regarding their experience and their thoughts about friendships and romantic interests of themselves and other campers. The interviews were coded for the extent to which the adolescent was willing to discuss people and relationships during the interview and the degree to which the participants were aware of the patterns of interaction in the social network around them. Results show that concurrent interest in relationships is a stronger predictor of social competence for participants with anxious histories, although participants with secure histories are more socially competent overall. This may indicate that participants with anxious histories must put in the effort of being interested in relationships in order to achieve social competence, whereas the skills of social competence come more easily to secure participants, whether or not they are explicitly interested in relationships in the given context.

Seventy-five patients referred to high-intensity psychosocial treatment due to chronic drug use were given 3 weeks to identify a drug-free significant other Patients noncompliant with this intervention were started on a methadone dose taper that was stopped when significant other support was identified. Patients and their significant others were required to attend a significant other group one time per week for a minimum of 6 weeks. Eighty-five percent of the patients brought a drug-free significant other into treatment. Significant others included family members, partners, and friends. Patients who identified significant other support complied with 77% of their scheduled sessions. The results demonstrated that most methadone patients have drug-free support people who are willing to participate in their treatment. These individuals can be utilized to help patients initiate the process of building new drug;free social support networks. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science Inc.

Only a few (6%) were ADL-dependent. Seventy-six percent had lost at least one nonwork activity, while vocational disability caused by the trauma occurred in 19%. Cognitive impairment was significantly associated with vocational disability, while physical impairment and pain were significantly associated with nonwork disability, Other parameters that influenced vocational disability negatively were age and blue-collar employment status. Although overall changes in social network quantity and quality were small, significantly more subjects with cognitive impairment or vocational disability experienced a decline in the quality and quantity of their social network after trauma. Furthermore, 25% of the subjects reported an increase in feelings of loneliness after trauma. We recommend the design of individualized, multidisciplinary rehabilitation plans before discharge from departments of surgery.

Because most CDCs are severely undercapitalized, they can not keep up with accelerating decay. Their existence, and the emphasis placed on their supposed successes, allow elites to blame poor neighborhood CDCs rather than external conditions for redevelopment failure. The model also emphasizes that CDCs be community-based, but because their resource base is controlled from outside the neighborhood there is really very little community control over CDCs. CDCs may evert delegitimize more empowerment-focused community organizing attempts by making them appear radical. Consequently, the CDC development process may actually disorganize poor communities by creating internal competition or disrupting social networks. An alternative model of neighborhood redevelopment is proposed which emphasizes community organizing, community-controlled planning, and high-capacity multi-local CDCs held accountable through a strong community organizing process.

Data were collected from a snowball sample of approximately 100 African- and Anglo-American women in Grand Rapids, Michigan, in 1989. Emphasizing the need for localized accounts of the feminization of poverty, attention is paid to specific aspects of these women's daily lives, namely their racialized experiences of economic restructuring, sources of income and household structures. Their division into ''work-rich'' and ''work-poor'' households is revealed further through an examination of their participation in formal and informal local social networks. I argue that their everyday experiences leave the weight of poverty falling more heavily on African-American women; living in the same place can take on different meanings for racialized social groups.

The relevance of this debate to the study of social dynamics has been reduced by a strong foundational bias and a lack of a proper view of individual agency. Notions of space and time, as well as social memory and culture, have been taken too much for granted. By constructivistically questioning these notions, suggests an alternative approach which explores a likely integration of autopoietic systems theory, agent-based models and network analysis. Considers its implications for research methodology.		Barbesino, P (reprint author), UNIV SUSSEX,GRAD RES CTR CULTURE & COMMUN,CULCOM,BRIGHTON BN1 9RQ,E SUSSEX,ENGLAND.						Aarseth E.

The incidence of divorce in the older (elderly parents) and younger generation (adult children) was taken into consideration. The results indicate that divorced older adults are less likely to have supportive exchanges with their adult children than non-divorced ones. The reduction in interaction is stronger among divorced fathers than divorced mothers. Parental divorce disrupts parent-child relationships, but this is not the case with younger generation divorce. Younger generation divorce strengthens rather than weakens parent-child ties. The intensity of intergenerational exchanges is highest in families where the parents' marriage remains intact but one or more of their children divorce. However, there also appear to be cumulative effects of parental and child divorce. The likelihood that parents and children will become estranged is greatest in families where members of both generations go through a divorce. The article ends with a discussion of the implications of the results for families of the future.

Continual neuroleptic maintenance therapy has proven to be superior to an intermittent treatment. A modification of the continual medication, i.e. a low dose maintenance therapy with basic symptom oriented early adaption of the dosage in the prodromes before psychotic relapses is just as effective, but reveals less side effects and better compliance. The presuppositions for the application of this modified maintenance therapy that may be, combined with supportive psychotherapy. the treatment of choice for the great majority of patients on a cost-benefit-basis. are delineated The question of a primary prevention of psychotic episodes of schizophrenia has been rarefy dealt with. There is evidence that early intervention in the prodromal precursor stages of schizophrenia can prevent the exacerbation of positive pyschotic symptoms and improve the longterm outcome. Also for this primary pevention of the psychosis the necessary condition is the knowledge of the dynamic and cognitive basic deficiencies. defined in the Bonn schedule BSABS. Early intervention has to be initiated, if dynamic-affective and especially transition relevant cognitive basic symptoms occur. It is shown that the prodromes according to the traditional psychiatry and the basic symptom research, constituted by basic symptoms that are experiential and not behavioural in kind, are not identical with the "Prodromal or Residual Symptoms" of DSM-III-R. A critical evaluation of the efficacy of the different kinds of social and psychotherapy yields that psychodynamic and socioemotional methods are not indicated in view of the increased vulnerability and endangering by overstimulation. There is no evidence that analytic psychotherapy and methods aimed at providing psychodynamic insight are effective in schizophrenia. Against it, an integral component of treatment seems to become a special psychological therapy based on an individualized behavioural-cognitive concept [s. 4&], taking into consideration the newer knowledge on schizophrenia acquired by basic symptom research. The patients need strategies of therapy and rehabilitation that refer to the deficits in living and social skills, the atrophied social networks and to the hitherto scarcely regarded cognitive basic deficiencies. The preferred mode of intervention has to combine rational pharmacological treatment with measures that train patients in the skills they need to cope with their basic symptoms and to function in the society.

One hundred and twenty six patients, evaluated and treated after a suicide attempt in a psychiatric ward, took part in a comprehensive investigation. This included questions on consumption of alcohol and tranquillizers and use of illegal drugs, independently of the psychiatric diagnostic procedure. More than half of the patients (59%) reported overconsumption of any kind or use of illegal drugs; 47% overconsumed alcohol (13% in a combination with tranquillizers), 10% overconsumed tranquillizers only, and 2% had used illegal drugs. Compared with non-overconsumers, overconsumers had more often made previous suicide attempts, and psychiatric co-morbidity on DSM III-R was commoner among overconsumers. The parents of overconsumers had more often been treated for psychiatric disorders, and alcoholism among fathers was commoner. The overconsumers of alcohol were younger and less often married, had a weaker social network, and had lower platelet monoamine oxidase activity. The psychosocial characteristics found in overconsumers underline the need for identification of these subjects, to prevent an escalation of a self-destructive life-style. A thorough investigation concerning use of alcohol and other substances is therefore essential in all suicide attempters; otherwise there is a risk that overconsumers without a DSM III-R diagnosis of substance use disorder may be undetected.

It was the first attempt in social sciences to describe and analyse organisational structures of Turkish migrants in Vienna, These networks are considered by the author as crucial for the development of political identity of immigrants. Social networks include a variety of loyalties and structures (regional, cultural, professional, religious, political, family,...) and thus transcend the purely ideological element many organisations claim to represent in the first place. These organisations, however, are regarded as central to the democratic process in host societies. Two of the most important umbrella organisations presented in this article on the basis of the findings in the study mentioned are Milli Gorus/Association of the National World-view and the IKZ/Union of Islamic Cultural Centres. They represent Islamist and neo-traditional organisations respectively. In the first case, it becomes obvious that the attempt to conduct "Islamic policies" or "Politics for Muslims" lends to considerable changes in structure and function of the organisation. The result is a "modernisation" of the organisation and a tendency to formulate policies for Muslim "interest groups" !women, students, small and medium enterprise businessmen,...). The second case shows that Islamic education and the willingness to uphold traditional structures (such as those of the tarikat, the Muslim brotherhoods! lead to political withdrawal in favour of the evolution of a religious, Muslim social elite. As a conclusion some questions for further research are posed that is necessary to understand the development, activities and aims of Turkish immigrant organisations.

The scheme used was a descriptive design. The information was collected based on a sample of 162 families through combinations of qualitative and quantitative techniques, and the results were managed by a percentage analysis of their frequency. Results indicates, that the social net potential is an alternative for social development, thought from the local contexts that guarantees the active society participation in the process of political, social and economical transformation that our country is facing nowadays.

SALUD PUBLICA DE MEXICO			Spanish	Article						HIV; AIDS; family; Mexico	AIDS; IMPACT; PEOPLE; UGANDA	Objective. To identify the critical points of the trajectories of the families of persons with AIDS which may serve as a basis to develop educational and support programs. Theory and methods, A qualitative investigation was conducted in 1995 in Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, State of Mexico, Mexico. Rapid Assessment Procedures (RAP) were applied to determine the social, economic, demographic and cultural context of persons with HIV/AIDS in the community. Forty-six in-depth interviews were applied to persons with AIDS, their families and people from their social networks. Results, The main aspects of the family response to the HIV/AIDS are characterized, and it is demonstrated that it is possible to identify critical points in such a response which can be targeted through specific interventions. In Ciudad Netzahualcoyotl, a context of poverty, a migrating tradition, and gender social relations are the basis of the acceptance or rejection of persons with AIDS. The main finding refers to the ambiguos attitude, ranging from rejection to support, displayed by family members of persons with AIDS. This pattern varies according to the history and specific conditions of each family. Conclusions, Specific health interventions are proposed to support families with one or more persons with AIDS.

However, Very few studies have been carried out, especially among the elderly, focusing on their social network and its ability to provide adequate support after myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to examine elderly persons' social network and need for social support three months after their first myocardial infarction. The sample consisted of 128 persons between 65 and 94 years of age who answered a questionnaire. The results showed that the subjects, even the oldest ones, had an available social network and that they were satisfied with the support it provided. There was an increased need for social support after the myocardial infarction, especially for emotional support and appraisal, but also for instrumental aid and information. Despite these positive results indicating that elderly persons with myocardial infarction have a social network, whose members provide them with support, there may be a need for support also from persons outside this network. Assessment of social network characteristics and the need for social support as well as the provision of adequate information about additional support networks are important tasks for all health professionals.

In this age group, smoking was related to intense pain in a logistic regression analysis (OR=1.58; 95% CI: 1.24-2.00; p<0.001), adjusting for age, gender, socioeconomic status, civil status, having children under 16, physical exercise, the presence of a musculoskeletal disease, and mental distress. The association remained significant after adjusting for workplace factors, social network factors, alcohol consumption, and intake of cod liver oil as dietary supplement.

Toxicologic, clinical, odontological, and psychiatric examinations were performed. More than 30% had medical causes for their complaints; 7% had severe diseases which had been unrecognized. The most common symptoms were diffuse pain, general weakness, fatigue, headache, and difficulties in concentrating. Anxiety and depression were the most prevalent psychiatric complaints. The psychological examination revealed a high prevalence of somatization. The treatment was information about mercury and amalgam, appropriate odontological routines without removal of intact amalgam fillings, medical therapy when necessary, and strengthening of the patients' social networks. Ninety percent were satisfied with the treatment. The results indicate that there are various explanations for the complaints of patients fearing "amalgam disease". No cases of mercury intoxication were found.

SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Meeting of the New-Zealand-Schizophrenia-Research-Group	APR, 1995	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND	New Zealand Schizophrenia Res Grp			EXPRESSED EMOTION; DISORDERS; PSYCHOSIS; ORIGINS; CULTURE; PERSPECTIVE; ILLNESS; PEOPLES	Schizophrenia is apparently less common in traditional than in nontraditional societies, and the course of illness in these cultural settings may also be more benign. Viral, political, economic, social labeling, and other explanations have been offered over the years for these differences. In contrast to those ideas that suggest the presence of a schizophrenogenic stress in urbanized, Westernized populations, I propose that traditional societies are actually schizophrenogenic compared with nontraditional societies. Assuming a multifactorial threshold model for the development of schizophrenia, traditional societies may be characterized by a lower threshold for developing schizophrenia in at-risk individuals. In the short term, this leads to a greater proportion of all clinical cases being of a less severe variety; in the long term, genes predisposing individuals to develop schizophrenia are exposed to the effects of negative selection, ultimately resulting in a relatively lower level of overt schizophrenia in these populations. The greater social demands placed on individual actors in traditional societies and the lack of variability in social network size may contribute to the (relatively) schizophrenogenic environment.

Results and Conclusions: Measures accumulated over times similar to the duration of infection are more informative than are static cross sections. The patterns of sexual mixing and network structure influence patterns of infection. In particular, the establishment of infection is most sensitive to the proportion of nonmonogamous pairs, the component distribution and cohesion among those with high activity. The subsequent prevalence is most sensitive to the assortativeness of mixing in the high-activity class and a measure of cohesion, both of which reflect the decrease in prevalence brought about by less widespread connections, A person's risk for infection is determined by local rather than global network structures.

Fifty-six children and their mothers were interviewed about the child's social support network. Social acceptance measures included peer sociometric ratings and teacher ratings of child preference and relationship quality. Frequency of contact with mother-nominated child network members was a determining factors in the concordance of mother and child reports. From the child's perspective, social acceptance was related to the presence and supportiveness of siblings and extended kin. Mother reports were less predictive, with only one significant association between parental support and teacher preference. In general, the children's perceptions regarding the structure and function of their social networks were found to be reliable and to relate meaningfully to social acceptance in the preschool domain.

The data come from it sample of 234 recent widows, aged 59-85, who completed seven interviews about their networks over a I-year period. We use these data to investigate the stability of both overall networks and individual ties, as well as the linkage between the stability of individual ties and the stability of the network's aggregate properties. We find that instability in these networks is best thought of in terms of an underlying 'core-periphery' structure, whereby some network members are likely to be named repeatedly (the core), while others are relatively unlikely to appear in any given elicitation of the network (the periphery).

Our data come from interviews conducted a decade apart with 33 Torontonians. There is much turnover in these networks, with only 27% of intimate ties persisting. Durable ties tend to be with intimates who have provided social support, are in frequent telephone contact, or are kin. There was almost complete turnover in the networks of those respondents who got married during the decade. By contrast, the amount of turnover in networks is not associated with whether the respondents had children, moved to a different home, or started/stopped doing paid work during the decade.

The paper addresses three questions: (1) To what extent did the same individuals continue to be active members of the women's social support networks across the decade; (2) to what extent did educational similarity explain which individuals continued to be active members of the women's networks; and (3) did educational similarity explain patterns of both support and socializing? The analyses revealed that between one-quarter and one-third of the associates named as sources of school/work support, general emotional support or socializing continued to be named 10 years after the first interview. The analyses also demonstrated that associates' educational attainment was important in explaining which individuals continued to serve as sources of support for school/work; however, educational attainment was not important in explaining which associates continued to serve as sources of either general emotional support or socializing.

Comparing the results of the two surveys reveals a large amount of change. Tianjin residents now report having more ties to Wends and to associates beyond work and family, and fewer workplace ties and far fewer family ties. Women have gained on men in the number of friends, and young people have fewer workplace ties. These changes at the micro-level are examined in the light of changes in the Chinese macro-social structure.

It is suggested that, in comparison with other strengths of ties (e.g. strengths of feelings, and frequencies of interactions), structural embeddedness: (1) is less under individuals' control, and therefore (2) tends to be more stable. Analyses of data on the relationships among male students at one small liberal arts college in November and April of their first year in college support the expectation that structural embeddedness is relatively stable, and tends to have some effect on other strengths of ties as well as the continuity of relationships.

Data were obtained from a random sample of 4820 people living in France interviewed by telephone between September 1991 and February 1992. This analysis was conducted on a subgroup of 1508 men and 1376 women in sexual relationships of less than five years. Multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression were performed. Our findings show that the adoption of preventive behaviour is far from depending exclusively on the awareness of risk. Individuals having a diversified sexual experience, who talked about sexuality during their childhood and have personal confidants more often reported having changed their sexual behaviour because of AIDS. Although less likely to select their partner in order to reduce the risk of AIDS, they more often adopt strategies directly linked to sexual interaction such as condom use. Individuals belonging to networks in which condom use is the norm are more likely to use them. Women, for whom stable relationships propitious to the development of emotional closeness carry a high social value, are more likely to rely on uniquely relational strategies in which the adaptation to the risk of infection involves a better knowledge of the partner. Our findings reveal that individuals attach a different degree of risk to their partners depending on whether they occupy a central or peripheral place in their network of sociability. Furthermore, we observed an incompatibility between the preventive and the socio-affective rationale in which condom use is inversely related to the degree of intimacy, regardless of what is known about the partner's serological status. Risk adaptation strategies are thus far from being irrational, but are related to individuals' socio-sexual biography, the logics of gender, social networks and milieux of sociability, and depend ultimately on the context of the relationship. As with other health-related behaviour, coping strategies appear to be the product of a complex interaction of biographical, social and cultural threads. Prevention campaigns based exclusively on the promotion of individual responsibility are thus likely to miss the mark.

However, quantification leads to inevitable oversimplification of multidimensional, intersubjective and contextual features of social support. The present paper explores qualitatively the social networks of six adults with learning difficulties (adults), selected from a sample of 32 because of the strategies they used to manage their social worlds. Three adults, who lived with parents, attempted to sustain non-confirmed identities in the face of rejection by others. The other three adults, who were separated from their families, had adopted fatalistic attitudes, despite feeling socially isolated and unsupported. The paper argues that non-confirmed identity maintenance and fatalism are both responses to social contexts that do not support an individual's sense of self-worth. The former is an attempt to manufacture positive identity in the absence of consensual alternatives. The latter involves acceptance of a social world that does not sustain valued social identities. The paper explores in detail the social contexts in which adults attempted to maintain non-confirmed identities or adopted fatalistic attitudes. The research provides a perspective on the management of behaviour defined from a frame of reference external to the individual as ''challenging'' or ''problematic''. Carers saw adults who sustained non-confirmed identities as having behaviour problems. However, these problems arose from adults' attempts to maintain self-esteem in stigmatising social contexts. The fatalistic adults did not cause behaviour ''problems'' for carers, but only because they had accepted lives which did not give them any sources of positive self-esteem.

A simple random sample of 23,864 Swedes and foreign-born people were interviewed in 1980-1981 and 1988-1989 by Statistics Sweden. In successive models starting with only ethnicity and age, one variable at a time was included in the two main models, one with material and economic factors and another with lifestyle factors as independent variables, in order to study how the importance of ethnicity changed. The age-adjusted relations between male and female Finns and severe long-term illness were reduced from an odds ratio of 2.37 and 1.86, respectively, to 1.90 and 1.70 after including educational status, marital status, exercise, smoking, and body mass index in the final model. The high odds ratios for males and females born in South Europe or born in non-Western countries decreased with the inclusion of lifestyle factors but were still high 2.26 and 2.50 in South Europeans and 1.94 and 1.81 in non-Westerners. Males and females born in Finland, South Europe or in non-Western countries had high odds ratios for severe long-term illness when education, material standard, economic resources, leisure opportunities and social network were simultaneously controlled for. People born in Western countries showed no association to limiting long-term illness. The conclusion of the present study is that ethnicity, defined as foreign-born people, was strongly associated with limiting long-term illness when controlling for social, material and lifestyle factors.

Health perception tends to vary according to different subcategories of the unmarried status. Logistic regression analyses indicate that health perception depends on marital status as well as on the quality of marriage and cohabitation. The health impacts of marriage are also determined by social network support.

There is a positive relationship between psychological distress and network size for the homeless who receive SSI while homeless individuals who do not receive SSI show a negative, non-significant association. We suggest the financial resources of SSI enable network members to become expressively involved with homeless individuals with relatively more psychological disturbance.

The target population are youth aged 12-18, housed in alternative settings such as residential child care facilities, psychiatric hospitals, or youth detention centers. This population is reliant upon residential programs for training and services, because they are unlikely to take part in school or other community-based programs.

Wellman, D. Knoke, S. Wasserman, M. Granovetter and the other scholars. The paper describes the relationship of the network analysis to dominant perspectives and explanatory schemes. Network analysis is presented here as the critical response to mainstream sociological research based on atomistic idea of social action and explaining social processes as the outcome of personal attributes and interiorised social norms. Special attention is given to basic network concepts and measures (density, structural equivalence, centrality/prestige prominence, bridge, broker, etc.), and to the description of various network analysis applications (occupational mobility, diffusion of innovation, the study of local and economic elites, inter-organizational cooperation, voting behaviour, etc.). Illustrations are also used from the author's life-history research projects (study of bourgeois elite under socialism and poor families) The author stresses the importance of the study of social relational context, which is rather neglected in Slovak sociology and regards as the main contributions of network analysis its emphasis on relational character of social action and precise elaboration of the concepts used in sociology rather in metaphorical way. She follows the view of D. Knoke (1994) that social network approach should be not taken as a competing paradigm but rather as the one embedding the normative and objective-rationalistic paradigms in the relational context of opportunities and limits for the exchange of information and sources.

We also ask whether these effects differ by gender. Our results show that using a contact with whom a job searcher shared membership in a fraternal/service organization decreased the probability that the searcher-contact tie was weak, but membership in these organizations and in church and recreational organizations increased the probability that the tie was gender homophilous. Both church and business voluntary organizational contexts had a positive effect on the use of a contact who was significantly older. Finally,for women, we find a negative effect of shared membership in school organizations on the probability that the searcher-contact tie was weak and,for men, a positive effect of business organizational context on the probability that the tie teas gender homophilous. We also find that voluntary organizational contexts exert indirect effects on search outcomes through these tie and contact characteristics, but these effects depend not only upon the type of voluntary organizational context and the gender of the searcher, but also upon the type of social resources through which the effects are exerted. We suggest that the structure of voluntary organizations may underlie these effects. In our conclusions, we examine the implications of these analyses for studying this and other tie contexts, for understanding resource-budding, and for studying the role of social networks in individual action.

The normative framework of social integration is then in danger. In this paper, specific forms of labour market marginalisation are distinguished and a complex of social and economic factors which influence labour market marginalisation in the Czech Republic is analysed. The analysis is based on qualitative investigations as well as on statistical data sets. The significance of interactions between labour demand and supply, human capital, economic incentives, discrimination, stigma, interactions with institutions and social networks form the focus of attention. The attempt to elaborate the typology of the strategies of the marginal labour force is presented. Labour-market marginalisation in the Czech Republic is being influenced by specific patterns of accumulation of handicaps of the labour force, as well as by the concept of marginal labour force as defined by employers, accepted by public employment service institutions and shared even by marginalised people. The strength of the tension between 'market status' and 'legitimate status' determine the emerging coping strategies of the marginalised labour-force. These are mostly active and enable an individual to leave such a marginal position either through jobs in the formal labour market or in the shadow, social or domestic economy. On the other hand some strategies only reinforce the marginal position and make it permanent.

The results demonstrate that social networks are important for mobilizing social support and that these mobilizing processes are characterized by sex differences: The family (i.e. the partner) is much more important for men than for women who rely both on family and non-family social networks. There are only weak relationships between social networks and social stress. Social support affects health positively by indirect mechanisms. From t1 to t2 social networks, social support and health remain rather constant while social stress changes substantially.		Suter, C (reprint author), ETH ZENTRUM,SEW,CH-8092 ZURICH,SWITZERLAND.

This paper relies on a 1986 Chicago, Illinois sample (n = 535) to consider the potential contributions of resources, social network characteristics, disaffiliation, and mental health problems. Results suggest that resource problems may determine homelessness regardless of drinking status. But drinking-associated problems may raise the resource threshold for ''vulnerability,'' reduce the protection afforded by social networks against both homelessness and ''vulnerability,'' increase the deleterious impact of disaffiliation, and spur complicating mental health problems.

Its theoretical basis, its construction and application are described and its usage in social network- and clinical-psychological research are discussed. According to its design it has to be worked through once a day, that is in the evening of each day. At this point all the subject's contacts that either lasted longer than 10 minutes or were perceived as subjectively significant are registered. In the first step all the people met are listed, then the relationship they have with the subject (e.g. partner, child, friend, close friend, neighbor etc.) is assessed. In the third step, each contact has to be described by six items representing the mode, significancy and duration of the contact, interpersonal stress experienced during the interaction, social support received during the interaction and the satisfaction with the contact. In a study with N = 25 subjects who registered their interpersonal contacts for 14 days the instrument showed good reliability and validity. Concerning validity the results make the discriminant validity of SONET-T obvious: II does indeed assess the actualized or interactive social network of a person contrary to "classical" network analytical instruments that examine the latent network structure a person is living in.

Three reasons to expect such a tendency are discussed. 1) Employers reward close personal contacts; this is designated the ''ascriptive employer.'' 2) The theory of ''weak ties'' maintains that using informal channels is efficient for job seekers and that employers have trust in information gathered through such channels. 3) Employers search for new employees through informal channels and offer jobs to the employees they believe are the most competent - that is, headhunting. Employees who are headhunted must also be expected to achieve high bargaining power. The findings indicate that the consequences of recruitment channel differ for lower- and higher-level employees. Getting a job through informal channels does not lead to wage advantages for lower-level employees. The highest wages among higher-level employees are obtained by those who have been contacted informally by the employer (that is, headhunted). Employees on this level also receive higher wages than those who are recruited through formal channels if they got their job by directly contacting the employers or indirectly, through weak ties. Those who get a job through weak ties do not have wage advantages compared with those who contact the employer directly or ave headhunted. Thus, the idea that getting a job through weak ties is especially advantageous for employees is not supported.

These processes are interrelated and they lead towards different mechanisms of social exclusion. This article stresses that not everyone excluded from the labour market, welfare provisions, or social networks has to be regarded as excluded from society. By developing survival strategies in different economic systems (market, reciprocity, associative redistribution) poor households try to escape from social marginalisation. The whole of their survival strategies is analysed in five different settings in and around Brussels. It is argued that these areas offer very different opportunities for social integration and community development, essentially related to the heterogeneity of the environment and the social cohesion of the population concerned.

Compared with old people living in private households, people living in residential care facilities show some sociostructural particularities which are hints at possible factors related to institutionalization. The following analyses of the factors related to institutionalization in old age result in a conformity of objective and subjective reasons: poor health, lack of social network and bad housing conditions in combination with needs for care are essential factors related to institutionalization. In addition, the question of denominational choice of the residential care facility and the question about migration in old age is examined mon closely. With regard to the religious community it is amazing that, in spite of secularization, there are major interdenominational differences. A further analysis of regional mobility suggests some sociostructural differences: women and widowed persons for example do not move over far distances (from the private household to the residential care facility), compared to men and married persons.

The role of the individual support network in the utilization of therapeutic offers	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR KLINISCHE PSYCHOLOGIE-FORSCHUNG UND PRAXIS			German	Article						psychotherapy; acceptance; social support; social network	HELP-SEEKING; HEALTH	The role of the social support network has rarely been addressed regarding the utilization and acceptance of psychotherapy. On the basis of existing research findings, two explanatory models are discussed in this article: The ''deficit model'' holds that the use of psychotherapy is an expression of insufficient support resources; according to the ''competence model'' a supportive network reflects social and relationship skills that also facilitate entering psychotherapy. These mechanisms are studied in depressed patient after discharge from inpatient treatment (N = 207) with respect to the utilization of individual psychotherapy and the acceptance of a cognitive-behavioural group program. As for nonkin support, distict effects emerge in line with an extended competence model. When diagnostic status is accounted for, the acceptance of the group program can be positively predicted by kin instrumental crisis support in remitted patients and negatively in the non-remitted patient group.

Infected persons are therefore confronted with psychological, social and physical problems and cope with them via different strategies and social resources. We investigated the question of what factors help to maintain a psychologically symptom-free state. Methods: A sample of 117 asymptomatic HIV-infected persons was recruited out of the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (Part A) in 1989 and 1990. The psychological symptoms were assessed with a self-rating questionnaire (SCL-90-R). The structured interview focused on social network, social support (SONET), and coping strategies (FEKB). Results: 79% of the asymptomatic persons did not report psychological symptoms. In multivariate analyses, ''rumination'' (= preoccupational thinking), female gender, and affectively negative relationships correlated with more, but affectively positive relationships and the strategy ''defence against threat'' with fewer, psychological symptoms. Additionally, there was no significant correlation between the immunological markers (CD4-, CD8-cell count, p24 antigen) and psychological complaints. Conclusions: The low number of asymptomatic HIV-infected persons with psychological symptoms (21%) is in accordance with other studies. Psychological symptoms and rumination correlate significantly in our sample. As rumination is difficult to recognize, HIV-infected patients should be directly questioned about rumination and their defence against threat should be supported in order to prevent the development of psychological symptoms.

Design-A simple random sample was drawn of 15 198 individuals aged 16-74 years. Of these, 85% (12 982) were interviewed by trained non-medical interviewers between 1982 and 1983 about cultural activities. They were followed up with respect to survival until 31 December 1991. Setting-Swedish interview survey of living conditions comprising a random sample of the adult Swedish population. Subjects-12 675 people interviewed between 1982 and 1983. Main outcome measures-Survival of subjects after controlling for eight confounding variables: age, sex, education level, income, long term disease, social network, smoking, and physical exercise. Results-6301 men and 6374 women were followed up; 533 men and 314 women died during this period. The control variables influenced survival in the expected directions except for social network for men; a significant negative effective was found when the analysis was made separately for men and women. We found an influence on mortality when the eight control variables were controlled for in people who rarely attended events compared with those attending most often, the relative risk being 1.57 (95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.09). Conclusion-Attendance at cultural events may have a positive influence on survival. Long term follow up of large samples with confounders that are well controlled for and with the cultural stimulation more highly specified should be used to try to falsify the hypothesis before experiments start.

The consistent association of social contacts with health and productivity provides strong support for the premise that intimate relationships are the focus around which people's lives revolve. Membership of a ''social network'' may be merely conforming to a reigning social norm, and this could mean having to pay an important price in the loss of creativity associated with individualism. But social conformity should not prevent individuals from going their own way, and it should be possible to combine the luxury of individuality with an active life in civic affairs. Less than complete freedom may fall short of existential utopia, but it may be best for our health and wellbeing.

Results indicated that hard of hearing university students in Sweden are from families of higher socioeconomic status than their hearing peers, have a greater number of minor medical complaints, report more frequent feelings of loneliness and mild depression, are more pessimistic about the future, experience greater anxiety, and have slightly weaker social networks and support systems. However, variables related to their educational settings indicated stronger commitment, greater academic and classroom integration, and a less stressful academic experience than their hearing peers.

Depressive symptoms predicted shorter longevity after controlling for symptoms and CD4+ cell count. Large social network sizes predicted longevity among those with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining symptoms at baseline, but not among other subjects. Therefore, psychosocial valuables and affective states may be related to disease outcome only during later stages of HIV disease. Although the results provide support for psychoneuroimmunologic effects in HIV other. confounding explanations may still apply.

Low-income parents (N = 500) of ethnically and ecologically diverse backgrounds completed a multidimensional hierarchical social map and measures of parental self-esteem and child-rearing practices. Consistent with prior ethnographic studies, American Indians had frequent interchanges with an interconnected web of kin; Hispanic(1) parents had large, close-knit social networks but a smaller number of people who provided emotional support; and Angle parents had structurally diffuse but emotionally supportive networks. Within-ethnicity regression analyses, covarying psychosocial risk, revealed that the affective but not structural dimensions of social networks were consistently related to parenting. Parental self-efficacy was strongly related to child-rearing practices across all ethnic groups, and mediated the effects of social support. Implications for the social ecology of child rearing and the central role of parental self-appraisals are discussed.

Twenty-five (18.1%) of the cases (n = 138) were single, 66 (47.8%) were married, 25 (18.1%) were divorced or separated, and 22 (15.9%) were widowed. Married patients were more likely to be male, to have an annual household income grater than $15,000, and to live with another person (p less than or equal to 0.01) as compared with those who were single, widowed, divorced or separated. Widowed patients were older on average and more likely to abstain from drinking alcohol. The cumulative survival among widowed patients at 12 and 24 months was 54.6 and 48.5%, respectively, as compared with 75.8 and 59.0% among single patients and 80.0 and 71.2% among married patients. The survival of divorced or separated patients was relatively good with a cumulative survival of 84.0% at both 12 and 24 months. Older age, lower ejection fraction, ventricular arrhythmias, bundle branch block, and marital status were significant predictors of survival in univariate analysis using the proportional hazards model. In multivariable analysis, age, race, ejection fraction, and marital status were statistically significant independent predictors of survival, with single patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy having a poorer survival than those who were married (adjusted RR = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.2, p < 0.05). The observed association with marital status may be explained by psychosocial factors not examined in the present study such as quality of social network or psychological stress.

Evaluation of the role a program plays in that system is an important evaluation question to address. A network analysis of program referral patterns was used to evaluate Connecticut's Healthy Start program. Network analysis showed that Healthy Start played a ''broker'' role in 4 case study communities, sending and receiving referrals of pregnant women to a higher than average number of other programs. Further, in the urban area case study, competing market players providing services to pregnant women resulted in subsets of services with dense referral patterns within the subsets but little referral between subsets. Healthy Start was found to be instrumental as an integrator of these otherwise disconnected service subsets.		Eisenberg, M (reprint author), UNIV CONNECTICUT,CTR HLTH,STORRS,CT 06269, USA.

Moreover, in the multimedia age, the time honoured centrality of the city is under threat from an 'abstract urbanism', whereby virtual cities are increasingly eclipsing the real cities. This has adverse consequences for the survival of the traditional European city, whose historical structures are in danger of becoming a meaningless backdrop. At the same time, the limits to urban planning are apparent; reliable models are lacking. Yet there remains the need to determine objectives to bring about constructive solution in the major areas of urban life. Three key fields of action are identified: mobility, communications, and transport are indispensable functions of the city; the traditional service of the city in providing a social network should be maintained; through ecological restructuring, the aim should be to adapt the urban structures to the demands of ecological compatibility. The question of the future of the European city remains open. If, during the transition to the information society, the city is to remain the site of cultural differentiation processes, then not only a clear political will, but also the commitment of the citizens is required.

The analyses reported here relate to changes in life satisfaction. The previously reported baseline analyses showed that poor health and functional ability were the strongest predictors of baseline life satisfaction. The results from the follow-up data presented here show that the most significant predictor of changes in life satisfaction at follow-up was baseline life satisfaction. While follow-up health and functional status, social network structure and activities explained the remainder of the explained variance, this was very little. The results are consistent with previous analyses of associations with changes in psychiatric morbidity (mainly depression) and highlight the importance of initiating early rehabilitation programmes.

As one moves south from arid into lusher ecoclimatic zones, the average size of ethnolinguistic groups decreases. Various factors are considered which may have contributed to this distribution. I argue that the ethnolinguistic map is primarily a reflection of the systems of generalized exchange and mutual dependence into which people enter. It is hypothesized that such social networks function to reduce subsistence risk due to variations in the food supply. If this hypothesis is correct, the average size of ethnolinguistic groups should be inversely proportional to the degree of ecological variability they face. This prediction is tested and found to hold strongly for a large part of West Africa. There is also Limited evidence of a correlation between Linguistic diversity and topography. It is concluded that ecological risk has been a key historical force in West Africa and that the ethnolinguistic mosaic can be used as a valuable ''fossil record'' of people's adaptive social and economic strategies.

Design - A logistic regression model was used for the analyses and included: education, marital status, socioeconomic group, social network, physical activities, cigarette consumption, and years spent smoking as independent variables. Men and women were analysed separately for smoking. A specific univariate analysis was also performed for men who used snuff. Setting - Sweden. Participants - A panel of 5104 randomised people aged 16-84 years was interviewed in 1980-81 and followed up in 1988-89 in the survey of living conditions undertaken by Statistics Sweden. The participation rate was 86%. The panel included 1546 men and women who were daily smokers. There were 418 daily users of snuff among the men, and 129 men both smoked and used snuff. Main results - Together 26% of women and 23% of men had quit smoking. Five per cent in both groups were new smokers. Among men, 26% had quit using snuff and 5% had begun smoking. New snuff users among men were 5%. In the multivariate analysis, unmarried men kept smoking at significantly higher rates (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.2,3.6), as did those men who smoked 11-20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.2; 95% CI 1.5, 3.4), or more than 20 cigarettes/day (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.4,5.7). Among women, smoking 11-20 cigarettes/day was also a significant factor (OR 3.3; 95% CI 2.1,5.0). Men and women aged 25-44 were significantly more Likely to continue smoking (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.1,3.7, and 2.2; 95% CI 1.2,4.4) as were those who had smoked for 20 years or more (OR 4.7; 95% CI 2.0,10.8 and OR 2.5; 95% CI 1.1,5.5, respectively). For women, low education (up to grade 9) was also a significant factor (OR = 2.5; 95% CI 1.2,5.1). Among men who had quit using snuff we did not find any values of significance. Conclusions - One in four smokers had quit during the 1980s and a few started smoking (5%). Some men quit smoking and started using snuff instead. For both sexes, the daily consumption of cigarettes, years spent smoking, and age were the most important determinants of successful quitting. In men, being married/cohabiting was an important factor as was higher education in women.

Three sets of correlates (demographics, assault characteristics, postassault experiences) of the timing of sexual assault disclosure and subsequent social reactions received from social network members were examined. Delayed disclosure was associated with childhood sexual assault history: completed rape, and avoidance coping, whereas early disclosure was associated with offender preassault alcohol use and postassault medical attention. Negative social reactions were more common among women who used avoidance coping and victims who told physicians or police about their assaults. Positive social reactions were associated with higher income, less physical injury due to the assault, less self-blame, less postassault distress, and saying that a friend/relative or a rape crisis center was helpful regarding the assault. Implications of these results for research and treatment of sexual assault survivors are discussed.

The relationships between alexithymia (Toronto Alexithymia Scale), social variables, and physical health and depression were examined in both healthy young adults and patients. Alexithymia (especially deficits in identifying and communicating feelings) was related to less perceived support, fewer close relationships, and less social skill; the social skills deficit accounted fully for the association between alexithymia and a smaller social network. Additionally, alexithymia was related to both somatic complaints and depression, but social support generally was not. It is concluded that alexithymia is associated with reduced perceived and network social support, that these associations are likely due to alexithymia-related deficiencies in social skills, but that reduced social support does not account for the relationship between alexithymia and health problems.

A total of 1265 persons out of an estimated target population of 5033 infected individuals were enrolled in the study. Coverage rates were higher in the intervention communities (30.3% for SN and 29.9% for IM) than control (7.3%) but the differences between intervention groups was not significant. A drop-off was seen in attendance at the second round of ivermectin distribution. Nearly equal proportions of the intervention groups returned (43.3% for SN and 47.4% for IM), while few control patients came back for their second dose (12.3%). Factors responsible for the low turnout were thought to include the content of educational messages, mobility of community members and limited time available to collect the drugs. Cost considerations led to recommendations to maintain facility based distribution and the SN approach, with greater emphasis on mobilization to increase coverage and compliance.

New relationships were more often nominated by women than by men. Formation of new relationships was strongly and positively associated with the duration of widowhood, the presence of a new partner. and having put effort into seeking new relationships. The findings suggest that, to gain a proper understanding of why some widowed individuals form new relationships and others do not, knowledge is required about the quality of the social network prior to widowhood.

Physiologic stressors were strongly associated with higher levels of physical dysfunction. Resources were generally unable to reduce deleterious effects of physiologic stress on functional outcomes; functional outcomes were largely determined by preexisting levels of function.

The mothers' social network was estimated using the Swedish version of Unden and Orth-Gomer's Interview Schedule for Social Interaction (ISSI). These mothers had been identified during early pregnancy. A control group of 57 children of the same age and their mothers without the presence of psychosocial risk-criteria was used as reference. The results indicated that the index children had experienced significantly more life events, and displayed significantly more behaviour problems than the reference children. The mothers in the index group had a significantly poorer social network than the mothers in the reference group. The study suggests that children of mothers, identified early on psychosocial risk criteria develop suboptimally. Therefore, early interventions are of great importance.

Using path model analyses, we found that: (1) personal empowerment had statistically significant direct effects on positive affect, meaningful activity, and negative affect; (2) positive social support mediated the relationship between the proportion of women in consumer/survivors' networks and positive affect and meaningful activity; and (3) negative social interaction mediated the relationship between consumer/survivors' gender and negative affect. The results point out the importance of gender effects in social support processes, the differential association between type of social interaction (positive vs negative) and adaptation indices (positive vs negative), and the importance of personal empowerment for consumer/survivors' adaptation. We discuss the findings in terms of their implications for further research and community-based housing programmes for psychiatric consumer/survivors.

Social service providers parlayed public sentiment toward homelessness into service-intensive programs. The homeless took advantage of such programs, not necessarily for the services, but as a way to more quickly get subsidized housing. The result was an unintentional conflict of interest and failed policy. The homeless remained in the program longer than assumed because of a shortage of subsidized housing and because the regimented services ultimately undermined what fragile social networks they had previously devised to survive.

The study population consisted of out-patients and in-patients (n = 1204) treated at the Department of Psychiatry of Kuopio University Hospital in North Save, Finland, during May 1993. Sociodemographic, psychosocial and clinical correlates of life satisfaction were examined by means of two different questionnaires, one directed at patients and the other directed at the staff. Life satisfaction was assessed by means of a separate scale based on four questions. Patients with schizophrenia were less dissatisfied than patients with other disorders. The strongest correlates of dissatisfaction were depression and poor social support. Other factors relating to dissatisfaction in multiple regression analysis were self-rated health and poor financial circumstances. A psychosomatic reaction tendency or degree of psychosocial functioning at the time of the study was not independently related to life satisfaction. Psychiatric patients who are dissatisfied should be evaluated both for depression and for effectiveness of their social network.

Women with larger support networks tended to be more responsive in interactions with their infants and to provide more stimulating home environments than mothers with smaller social networks. Activity level was the only infant outcome significantly related to social support. Family structure was not associated with either maternal or child outcomes in these analyses. These results support a systems model of parenting behavior and child development by indicating that maternal caregiving may be positively influenced by supportive social networks.

In response, a cohort of 1276 male and female undergraduate students was surveyed at a major university in the country. Among the study participants, 21% (270) reported regular, weekly use of alcohol. Men were much more inclined to drink on a weekly basis than women; and, 7% of the students who used alcohol regularly did so on a daily basis. Approximately 70% of the students who used alcohol drank in the company of friends; and, one-third of the alcohol using students reported that it was important to have their friends with them when they used the substance. Student background characteristics found to be associated with weekly alcohol use included: gender, age, country of origin, economic status, academic discipline, father's level of education, and parents' use of alcohol and legal medication. An important finding of this study was that 30% of the students who used alcohol reported driving a car after drinking and 3% of this sub-population drank while driving. Alcohol tends to be used and abused more than any other licit or illicit substance among Israeli university students. This issue, however, receives far less attention than illicit drug use in terms of education, public awareness, prevention and treatment activities. Alcohol use and abuse among university students in Israel is far from the major problem found elsewhere. Nevertheless, planned prevention and other forms of intervention are needed on campuses throughout the country.

To assess the influence of peers on drug users' risk behaviors this study examined the association between individual level and group level behaviors. This analysis reports on the prospective association between baseline self-reported drug and alcohol use of the network members of injection drug users, and self-reported sexual behaviors and alcohol use at 5-month follow-up. Participants were a nontreatment sample of inner-city injection drug users who volunteered for a network-oriented HIV preventive intervention. They were predominately unemployed, African American males. Of the 71 index participants who completed both the baseline and follow-up interviews, 227 of their drug network members were enrolled in the study. At baseline indexes' sexual risk behaviors were significantly associated with their drug network members' level of crack cocaine use. At follow-up higher levels of alcohol and crack use among drug network members were associated with indexes' reports of multiple sex partners and increased alcohol consumption. Higher levels of crack use among the drug network members were associated with the indexes' reporting casual sex partners at follow-up. These results highlight the importance of studying the role of peer group influence and the social context of risk behaviors.

As predicted, consistent with a prototype-based model of health risk behavior (F. X. Gibbons & M. Gerrard, 1995, in press), smokers with more favorable perceptions were more likely to have relapsed at follow-up. Also as predicted, this prospective effect was moderated by smokers' social networks: Prototypes did not predict status among those who had a lot of friends and family members who smoked, suggesting that these other smokers were inhibiting smokers' attempts to distance themselves psychologically from the prototype. Implications of the results for interventions that use prototypes to discourage smoking are discussed.

The use of network analysis to model the effects of social contagion on personal attributes is demonstrated in an evaluation of an organizational intervention. Sociometric indices of the norms created by social contagion predicted subjects' self-perceptions better than either expectations imposed on them in small groups or their own observable behavior. Social contagion stabilized the subjects' self-perceptions over time, despite the efforts of the intervention to change their self-perceptions through small group socialization and organizational restructuring. Network models of social contagion may provide useful tools for the design and evaluation of interventions that aim to change the attributes of individuals who form social systems. Further, these models theoretically integrate social relations and social cognition in a manner that helps to bridge the sociological and psychological study of human relations.

The patients were followed from an initial admission, through hospital stay, discharge, follow-up (M = 31 months), and possible relapse. Outcome variables were the length of stay in the hospital at the key episode and time to relapse, defined as a marked exacerbation or return of schizophrenic symptoms requiring inpatient or expansion of outpatient treatment. Multivariate analyses showed that a psychosocial variable, the availability of attachment, was the only independent predictor of length of stay in the hospital. Age at admission was a strong predictor of time to relapse. Age interacted with both outcome and electrodermal activity, and young electrodermal nonresponders were found to have the shortest time to relapse. At the I-year followup, a main relapse effect was found for patients with a low skin conductance level.

Drug users' social context was assessed through an analysis of personal networks, and the environmental context of drug use was assessed through a delineation of injection settings. The 330 respondents participating in an HIV prevention study were administered two surveys an average of 5.2 months apart. An examination of the association of network characteristics at baseline and needle sharing at followup revealed that the factors of higher total network density, larger drug network size, and injecting at friends' residences were positively associated with reports of sharing needles that had been cleaned with bleach. Sharing of needles that had not been disinfected with bleach was positively associated with reports of injecting in semipublic areas (streets, rooftops, parks, cars, public bathrooms, and abandoned buildings). These data support ecological and resource models of needle sharing and suggest the potential utility of network-oriented strategies for reducing needle sharing among injecting drug users.

Reports by the caregivers indicated that friends were the most prominent source of emotional support, while siblings were the greatest source of instrumental support and interpersonal stress, both shortly after the parents' diagnosis and two years later. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that associates who had cared for family members themselves were more likely to have been sources of instrumental support both shortly after diagnosis and two years later. Caregiving similarity was also the most important factor in explaining both emotional support and interpersonal stress at T1; however, its effect diminished across the subsequent two years. These findings suggest that experimental similarity may become less important in explaining some dimensions of interpersonal relations as individuals move further from status transitions.

Women received significant support for combining paid work and child rearing, but these gender-specific benefits contributed to cementing the gender division of labor in both the family and labor market These contradictions combined with specific social networks to support a rapid feminist mobilization. This new women's movement was soon undermined by German unification, which changed the form of politics to electoral competition and shifted priorities to defending rights. However short-lived, this feminist mobilization offers important perspectives on socialist policy and the value of domestic labor.

The scientific objectives and requirements derive from network science investigations (seismology, meteorology), which provide results at global and regional scale, and from individual site characterization in terms of geology division, geomorphology, geochemistry, iron and volatile studies, and atmospheric structure, at a local scale. After the scientific requirements were fully addressed, a careful evaluation of the mission constraints arising from technical design and mission analysis requirements was carried out. The constraints considered in the study arose from launch scenario, probe delivery and atmospheric entry, landing site altitude and latitude, site terrain characteristics, data relay orbiter, planetary protection, and from the network configuration requirements for the different mission scenario options. A detailed study of the surface of Mars has revealed a set of 100 potential landing sites, all of them scientifically meaningful and technically feasible. These sites form a catalogue of potential landing sites, allowing to optimize the specific investigations of the martian atmosphere, surface and interior, to be performed by the INTERMARSNET mission. The catalogue has been used as a database for the selection of landing site configurations satisfying the network science requirements. Two options in the mission scenario have been considered in the study, the Single-Probe Carrier (SPC) and the Multi-Probe Carrier (MPC). For each option six landing site configurations, each composed of four landers, a three lander regional network plus one antipodal site, have been selected, that way to fulfil the scientific objectives and to be fully compatible with the targeting and delivery capability of the adopted mission scenario option. Of the six configurations for each option, four are targeted to the Tharsis region and two to the Elysium region. These two regions have been selected to host the regional network because they are the most likely areas on Mars to still undergo tectonic activity. For each option one of the configurations has been selected as the mission baseline. Both baseline configurations, for MPC and SPC, are targeted to the Tharsis region.

An unambiguous determination of the wind systems associated with the general circulation requires simultaneous measurements from at least 15-20 globally-distributed surface stations and a single, high inclination, short period orbiter. The required number of stations would be too costly using conventional multi-instrumented lander designs. However, truly global network science for meteorology can be accomplished using landers instrumented for a single measurement, namely pressure. Pressure is the most important meteorological parameter and pressure sensors do not require deployment or orientation. This facilitates the design of relatively simple landers that are sufficiently small and light that the required number can be launched on a single Med-Lite launch vehicle (see the accompanying paper by Merrihew et al. (Planet. Space Sci. 44, 1385-1393, 1996)). Of equal importance, the low power demand of the stations would allow them to last for a Martian year and provide the necessary seasonal coverage. The rationale and measurement requirements are given for such a network, and it is shown how it would contribute to the understanding of the Martian general circulation and climate system. In particular, the number and siting of stations is discussed, and the basic science specifications for barometric pressure sensors and an atmospheric sounder. The proposed mission would, for the first time, observationally define the seasonally-varying global wind held on another planet.

Measurements of surface pressure distributed both spatially and temporally, coupled with simultaneous measurements from orbit, will enable the determination of the general circulation, structure and driving factors of the Martian atmosphere as well as the seasonal CO2 cycle. The influence of these atmospheric factors will in turn provide insight into the overall Martian climate system. With the science objective defined as the long-term (at least 1 Mars year) globally distributed: measurement of surface atmospheric pressure, a readily achievable and low-cost network mission has been designed. The mu-Met mission utilizes microsensors coupled with a robust and lightweight surface station to deliver 16 mu-Met stations to Mars via a Med-Lite launch vehicle. The battery powered mu-Met surface stations are designed to autonomously measure, record and transmit the science data via a UHF relay satellite. Entry, descent and landing is provided by an aeroshell with a new lightweight ceramic thermal protection system, a parachute and an impact absorbing structure. The robust lander is capable of surviving the landing loads imposed by the high altitude landing sites required in a global network. By trading the ability to make many measurements at a single site for the ability to make a single measurement at many sites, the mu-Met mission can provide truly global meteorological science.

The effectiveness of social skills training/social network restructuring in the primary and secondary prevention of drug use was examined in a multiethnic cohort of 296 female adolescents ages 14 to 19 years who were pregnant or parenting and/or at risk for drug use. Methods. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: (a) PALS Skills Training or (b) a control intervention involving no skills training. PALS Skills Training is a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques to improve social skills and to restructure the teens' social network. All students also participated in a Is-week normative education ''Facts of Life'' course. Results. The prevalence of alcohol and any drug use increased significantly over the three assessment periods in the PALS Skills group but not in the No Skills group, Teens in the PALS Skills group who reported no drug use at baseline were 2.9 times as likely to be using marijuana than teens in the No Skills group at 3 months postintervention. PALS Skills Training was no more effective in the secondary prevention of drug use than the control intervention. Conclusions. Social skills training was found to be ineffective as a means of primary prevention among non-drug-using high-risk adolescents and may even be counterproductive as a means of primary prevention of marijuana use in this population. When combined with normative information on drug use prevalence, acceptability, and hazards, social skills training is no more effective as a means of secondary prevention than normative education alone.

Originally all patients had lived with their relatives. Patients who lived with spouses or alone (each 20%) had quite a good outcome and a fair social integration. After 8 years 40% still lived with parents. They needed much support from them for their course of illness was moderate. 20% lived in sheltered accomodations and had a poor integration. For all the relatives were the most important reliable persons in social networks which decreased during the course of illness.

At the macrolevel, the major factors examined were population size, population density, number of dwelling units in the site, urbanity of the area, ethnic heterogeneity, and peripheriality of the region. Three kinds of variables were examined on the microlevel: (a) personal attitudes: evaluation of the dwelling unit and satisfaction with public services; (b) social networks; and (c) sociodemographic characteristics. Data were collected from 242 immigrants from the former USSR and from 60 Israeli veterans, residing in 5 different sites. Two different patterns of predictors of sense of community emerged in the two different samples. In the veteran sample, only one macrolevel variable entered the stepwise analysis equation: the number of dwelling units in the site. In the immigrant sample, three significant microlevel factors entered the equation: evaluation of the dwelling unit, external network, and age. The data thus suggest that the major determinant factors underlying sense of community vary for different groups of people.

Subjects were 216 children ages 8-15 years. Sociometric nominations were used to determine the identities of reciprocal friends. Loneliness at camp was also tracked over time. In addition, data on group acceptance, behavioral reputations, social competence, and behavioral problems were gathered from peers and counselors. Analyses suggested that friendship formation and duration were coherent, independent dimensions of individual differences and distinct from the overall extensivity of involvement in friendships. Regression analyses indicated that the temporal parameters of participation in friendship enhanced the prediction of changes in loneliness at camp. Age and sex differences in temporal parameters were explored, and 4 discrete trajectories for friendship involvement were identified. Children with different trajectories differed in their behavioral profiles from one another and from children who were chronically friendless.	UNIV MICHIGAN,ANN ARBOR,MI 48109							Asher S.

Fifth and sixth graders (N = 227) completed a rating-scale sociometric to index popularity and provided information on up to 15 good friends. Results indicated that all children reported having at least one unilateral friend. Unpopular children were less likely than popular children to have at least one reciprocal friend, although the large majority (77%) did have a reciprocal friend. Results also indicated that unpopular children's unilateral friendship networks, in comparison to the networks of their more popular peers, contained a greater number of younger school-age friends and fewer same-age friends, more friends located outside of the school but within the same school district, and more unpopular and fewer popular school friends. Unpopular children's reciprocal friendship networks were significantly smaller, were more evenly distributed within and outside of the classroom, and contained fewer average and popular friends as well as friends of the opposite sex. Findings suggest advantages to using an unrestricted friendship nomination instrument and emphasize the need to consider both popularity and friendship when investigating children's peer relationships.

Although the legal Left in Peru in 1980 was a formidable social and political force, by the early 1990s it was eclipsed by the Shining Path insurgency and the autocratic neoliberalism of President Alberto Fujimori. The crisis undermined the conditions for class-based collective action and fragmented the social networks that sustained the support of the United Left coalition. The United Left was also polarized in competing camps as different parties and leaders adopted divergent strategic responses to the national crisis. The collapse of partisan representation created a political void highly conducive to new forms of personalist leadership.

A survey data for 259 women and 185 men were analyzed, and main findings were as follows: 1. With marriage, support agents of women and men change extensively in their social networks. Wives have more variety in support agents within their social network, through children to their friends' parents. On the other hand, husbands' agents are likely to be confined to their wives and children. 2. Wives and husbands are similar in that their first choice for seeking advice is their spouse. A friend is the second choice for both of them. While parents, brothers and sisters serve as wives' third choice, there is no third for husbands. 3. Enrichment of wives' social network, based on a well-functioning relationship with husbands, leads to a lower degree of social isolation experienced by them.

In this article, help seeking pathways for children are defined and a pathway model is presented. Influences on help-seeking pathways are then reviewed, including illness profile variables, predisposing factors, and barriers to and facilitators of care. Research targets such as the role of informal supports, collateral services, and cultural influences on help-seeking are recommended. Methodological considerations are presented that include assessment of clinically defined mental health need as well as subjective assessment of need, use of complementary qualitative and quantitative methods, and use oi cross-system data. The implications for practice and policy of research on help-seeking pathways are described.

Various models can examine heterogeneity in sexual behavior and determine how individual variation influences epidemiologic pattern within a population. In the cases of heterogeneity in sex acts and in sex partner numbers, heterogeneity acts to enhance the likelihood of the persistence of infection. Also important is the pattern of mixing or sexual contact within a community. Assortative mixing promotes rapid spread in high-sexual-activity classes but results in a lower endemic equilibrium state compared with random mixing. In these models, each facet of behavior is treated separately. The obvious next goal of modeling is to meld processes together into a single mathematical framework; however, quantitative epidemiologic information on each factor is still needed.

Efforts to date, including the application of population ecology, the development of the core group hypothesis, and the use of compartment models to describe disease transmission, have aided in understanding the dynamics of transmission and have highlighted the relationship between personal risk taking and population risk. An area for further development is the application of the techniques of social network analysis to infectious disease spread. Initial work suggests that social structure may act as a barrier (or facilitator) in disease transmission and that the epidemiologic impact of a risky act varies with the social setting. The local context for risk behaviors has important implications for the dynamics of transmission.

As STD epidemics move through these phases, the sexual and social networks that fuel them become located in subpopulations characterized by progressively higher rates of sex partner change and less contact with the health care system. As a result, phase-appropriate prevention strategies and research issues are essential to reducing STDs and their consequences.

Cases and controls were selected from among 1,426 participants in the Erie County Risk Factor Study. We found differences among those who scored higher than their peers on measures of social strain. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for the association between case status and Role Strain score of 2.27 or more was 2.84, 95% CI = 1.08 to 7.46. We also examined serum antibody, dichotomized at the median, for three periodontal pathogens (Bacteroides forsythus [IgG Bf], Porphyromonas gingivalis [IgG Pg], Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans [IgG Aa]), and assessed interaction between antibody levels and a Depression score derived from the Brief Symptom Inventory, IgG Pg and IgG Aa were both strongly associated with case status (OR = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.99 to 10.3 and OR = 5.29, 95% CI = 2.34 to 12.0, respectively), IgG Bf was associated with periodontal disease but only among individuals who had higher scores for Depression (OR = 6.75, 95% CI = 1.25 to 36.5). Smoking status was associated with case status (OR = 4.95, 95% CI = 1.85 to 13.2). We assessed these findings prospectively by examining factors associated with more extensive disease among the 71 case subjects after 1 year of follow-up. We found baseline smoking status and IgG Bf among individuals scoring high on Depression at baseline to be associated with more extensive disease (8.1% or more of the sites showing further breakdown), In this population an elevated Depression score may be a marker for social isolation, which could play a role in immune function during periods of social strain. This exploratory analysis has served to identify specific lines of inquiry concerning psychosocial measures as important environmental factors in adult periodontitis.

For example, if one of the two vertices that are colored the same is connected to three yellow vertices, two white and red, then the other vertex is as well. Exact regular colorations have been discussed informally in the social network literature. However they have been part of the mathematical literature for some time, though in a different format. We explore this concept in terms of social networks and illustrate some important results taken from the mathematical literature. In addition we show how the concept can be extended to ecological and perfect colorations, and discuss how the CATREGE algorithm can be extended to find the maximal exact regular coloration of a graph.

Psychosocial factors have received increasing attention from researchers studying the causal factors of non-specific back pain. However, most studies focus on few dimensions, like individual or work-related factors. We studied the simultaneous association of various factors representing psychosocial, behavioral, and health-related dimensions to self-reported back pain. Data from the Berne Workplace Health Project on 850 employed men and women was analyzed. Back pain was operationalized by a dichotomized variable (having suffered moderately to severely from back pain in the preceding four weeks). The theoretical model guiding the underlying project was a general demand-resource model. Variables that-according to that model-were hypothesized to be related to back pain as well as more specific factors-like physical work load-were analyzed by stepwise logistic regression analysis. in men, there was a statistical trend (P < 0.1) for several work-related factors (low job discretion, high job demands, low job satisfaction). In women, dissatisfaction with salary was the only work-related factor associated with back pain. There was no significant association between private context factors, like poor social network or high demands/low control, and back pain. Only in men, the likelihood of back pain increased with age, while only in women, back pain was associated with emotional problems (individual factors). Among the behavioral factors, smoking was associated to back pain in men, while in women none of the behavioral factors was significant. In both men and women reporting more than two functional symptoms and a history of intestinal problems were associated to back pain. All of our findings were in the expected direction, i.e. it was invariably unfavorable categories of explanatory variables that were associated with higher prevalence of back pain. However, most associations seem to be quite unspecific. There is a need for theoretically guided research aiming at the development of a more complex process model of back pain.

This assumption is supported by sociological studies of migrant networks. With endogenous moving costs migration occurs gradually over time. Once it starts, it develops momentum, and migratory flows may increase even as wage differentials narrow, In addition, migration tends to follow geographical channels, and low-moving-cost individuals migrate first. These patterns are consistent with historical evidence from the Great Black Migration of 1915-1960, much of which cannot be reconciled with existing migration models.

The program methods are based on social network theory research, which has found that key lay people in communities can be identified and trained to carry out prevention programs. The educational content is based on theories suggesting that characteristics of healthy, adaptive individuals and communities can be taught, A violence-prevention leadership program is provided to a cohort of middle-school student peer leaders and their parents and for the leaders of the neighborhoods around cite middle schools, Three matched pairs of urban middle-school attendance zones were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or serve as a nonintervention control group. Surveys, interviews, and observations were conducted with the peer leaders, their parents, community leaders, and community residents. Sixty-six percent of the peer leaders reported that they had hit someone in the past 30 days. Twenty-six percent of the sixth-graders had punched or beaten someone in the past 30 days. Within the past year, 6% of the adults had slapped or kicked someone. Within the past 30 days, 14% of the sixth-graders had been punched or beaten. Within the Fast year, 6% of the adults had been punched or beaten. A large percentage of adolescents are victims and perpetrators of violence and are exposed to violence in their neighborhoods, Violence-prevention strategies can be implemented through collaborations among health departments, community-based organizations, universities, and schools. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH): violence, primary prevention, program evaluation, longitudinal studies, adolescence, peer group, minority groups, school-age population, community.

A search of the literature published since the mid-1970s (under the MEDLINE key words, ''social ties,'' ''social network,'' ''social isolation,'' ''social environment'') presented strong evidence that social integration lends to reduced mortality risks, and to a better state of mental health. The evidence on physical health outcomes is less conclusive. There is no consistent evidence that social integration affects the incidence of disease (at lease for cardiovascular outcomes). However, social integration does appear to have a highly beneficial effect on post-myocardial infarction prognosis (functioning and longevity). A physiologic basis for these effects on health outcomes is also indicated by research demonstrating that both social isolation and nonsupportive social interactions can result in lower immune Junction and higher neuroendocrine and cardiovascular activity while socially supportive interactions have the opposite effects. In conclusion, available data suggest that, although social integration is generally associated with better health outcomes, the quality of existing ties also appears to influence the extent of such health benefits. Clearly, individuals' networks of social relationships represent dynamic and complex social systems that affect health outcomes. (C) 1996 by Elsevier Science Inc.

Fourteen students who suffered from syncope and 12 other students from the same class with no symptoms were assessed by a team of psychologists and paediatricians with the aim of identifying the cause of the problem and to formulate possible,remedial action. Psychological assessments included a mental state examination, developmental, personal and psychological history, state-trait anxiety, self-esteem, hypnotic suggestibility, and students' beliefs about the cause and nature of the syncope attacks. Physical investigations included physical examination, blood pressure and electro-cardiogram. The results indicated that most participants and controls had no physical or psychological pathologies. The two groups were not different on the physical and psychological measures. Analyses of the interview data, however, indicated that all the syncope sufferers belonged to a cohesive and exclusive social network. Social psychological circumstances rather than individual psychopathology were noted to be primarily responsible for the spread and maintenance of the mass hysterical influence. Intervention consisted of health education, authoritative reassurance and back-up support. Follow-up assessment after three and 12 months indicated no further syncope episodes.

What will be the kinds of skills required for them to make a useful contribution in the provision of information systems? This paper reflects on these issues, drawing on the IS and innovation diffusion literatures. Following a review of electronic vis a vis social networks, the paper foresees the latter as crucial in the construction and diffusion of new knowledge in an IS community. A main contribution of the paper is that it utilizes a variety of disciplinary perspectives in order better to understand and improve use of information in organizations. This approach is in line with the view that in the future transdisciplinary forms of knowledge production will make traditional, disciplinary-based knowledge domains largely obsolete (Gibbons, 1995) and that knowledge relevant to IS professionals will be no different in this respect. Given this, the future role of the IS professional is portrayed here as that of a key change agent in the development, diffusion, and implementation of new ideas. A primary activity is foreseen as being one of bringing together and synthesising information, ideas, and practices from a range of disciplines with the focus being on information leading to the development of knowledge leading to the development of knowledge and expertise within organizations, not systems per se. The paper concludes by identifying implications of this analysis for IS curriculum development.

EARLY CHILDHOOD RESEARCH QUARTERLY			English	Article							CHILDRENS PEER RELATIONS; SOCIOMETRIC STATUS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; SCHOOL; REJECTION; PATTERNS; AVERAGE	In a preschool setting, the naturally occurring aggressive behavior of sixty-four 4-year-old children was observed and recorded. Individual differences in gender, behavioral style, social competence, reciprocal friendship, and social clique membership were examined to understand how these variables might be related to children's aggressive behavior. Variations in children's aggressive behavior were found to be associated with behavior style and social competence with peers. Children within social cliques were relatively similar in the frequency of their observed aggressive behavior. The results suggest that efforts to decrease children's aggression might target groups of children rather than individuals.

Two interviews with the preadolescents and their families, using a battery of questionnaires, were conducted in the home. Results showed no group differences in the size of preadolescents' social networks. In terms of who they turn to for social support, preadolescents with mild mental retardation were more likely to turn to people in the home and adults outside the home for companionship, while preadolescents without mental retardation turned to peers. Further, the more negative the family environment, the more preadolescents turned to adults outside the home for emotional and problem solving support. lastly, preadolescents who received greater emotional and problem solving support from people in the home, experienced fewer adjustment problems. The importance of a positive family environment for providing needed emotional support and the implications of the lack of peer companionship for preadolescents with mild mental retardation, as they enter adolescence, is discussed.

Based on archival research, oral history, and detailed field research, this study illustrates the ways in which access to and availability of resources through social networks and markets over time ave critical to farmers' decisions about how to use their labor and land This detailed local study of agrarian change examines how wider regional processes of change affect focal conditions. It demonstrates that population growth neither results automatically in intensification nor in degradation of the resource base. The paper also attempts to explore how ideas about farming and ''progress'' shape farmers' decisions about land use.

Based on the value-expectancy framework of migration decisionmaking, an explanatory model is tested which includes migration-related value measures along with individual, household and community-level determinants of both intentions to move and change in intentions to move. Multinomial logistic regression results based on data from the 1992 Thailand National Migration Survey provide some support for the hypothesis of gender-specific determinants of both intentions to move and the reconsideration of migration intentions. For men, value measures of affiliation and comfort, social networks, the presence of young children in the family, and land holdings are significant determinants of migration decisionmaking; for women income and comfort values, the presence of elderly persons in the household, community size, and crop losses are the salient factors. The results are discussed in light of traditional and current cultural expectations for men and women in rural Thailand.

Using probit regression techniques, a significant negative relationship was found to exist between parent-child stress and successful component completion for there participants. Further assessment probed the contribution of study participants' personal and social strengths and problem-child behaviors as contributors to stress: Lower levels of mastery and higher perceived levels of child problem behaviors were found to be associated with the level of stress in the parent-child relationship. Findings, although preliminary, suggest the desirability of further research examining family dynamics as potential contributors to successful employability outcomes for this and similar populations.

This article presents three studies that test this hypothesis. In Study 1, participants described the personal qualities and supportiveness of an individual from their social networks. Study 2 experimentally manipulated the personal characteristics of targets by using a hypothetical other paradigm. In Study 3, strangers participated in brief interactions, and then rated each other on supportiveness and other personal characteristics. In each study, persons were seen as supportive insofar as they were perceived as similar to subjects, and as being conscientious. As predicted, these judgments could be made with very little information about targets, and with no information about the provision of supportive behaviors. Further, the same information used to make initial support judgments was used in thinking about well-established relationships as well.

JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY AND SOCIAL WELFARE			English	Article							UNITED-STATES; HEALTH; WOMEN	U.S. welfare reform initiatives are based on the assumption that the primary barriers to economic independence are individual deficits. However, the policy does not adequately account for situational and personal factors necessary for a successful transition from welfare to work. Without greater attention to these barriers, the policy is likely to fail or be implemented at high personal cost to recipients and their families. This paper uses a person-in-environment social systems framework to examine the personal and family resources available to a group of women who were receiving AFDC and participating in an urban Head Start program. Structured interviews and literacy assessments with 77 AFDC recipients participating in a Head Start program indicate that the barriers to self-support are not related to substance abuse, health problems, deficits in literacy, or a lack of interest in work. However, most caregivers do not have adequate training or education to prepare them to compete ill the job market, nor do they feel equipped to find a job on their own. The results with respect to family resources are mixed. While families possess a number of coping mechanisms, caregivers have little support from social network members for day-to-day child care activities. The implications of the findings for welfare policy are discussed.

The developmental synthesis perspective views social growth as the integration of biological, psychological, and sociological features. Issues in the social skills deficit framework are examined along with the theoretical foundations of the developmental synthesis perspective. From this discussion, it is concluded that social interventions for students with disabilities should include a focus on the characteristics of the classroom social network as well as the characteristics of the individual. The literature on the formation of classroom social networks and their role in individuals' behavior development is reviewed. Three critical points emerge from this review: (a) Formal and informal social processes are likely to constrain the social opportunities of students with disabilities in both special and regular education placements; (b) following from these constraints, students with disabilities are at risk for associating with peers who negatively influence their social growth; and (c) such associations are likely to impede or prevent positive outcomes for social skills training programs. Implications for the delivery of educational services, as well as social interventions, are considered and future research needs are briefly outlined.

Self-efficacy perceptions were assessed for eight domains of living: productivity, health, transportation, family relationships, relationships with friends, finances, safety, and living arrangements. Using pooled logistic regression models, both baseline and time-varying predictors of decline and improvement ire self-efficacy were examined. The results indicated that while demographic and health factors were predictive of decline in self-efficacy for some domains of living, the most consistent predictors of decline were psychosocial characteristics. Specifically, prior levels of depression were associated with decline in the transportation, family relationships, relationships with friends, financial, safety, and living arrangements domains of living. The presence of a domain-specific hassle was associated with a decline in self-efficacy for the transportation,family relationships, finances, and living arrangements domains. In addition, lower levels of social network contact were predictive of decline in the health and safety domains, and the absence of instrumental support was also associated with decline in the productivity, health, and transportation domains of living. Improvements in self-efficacy perceptions were associated with fewer of the health and psychosocial characteristics and were primarily influenced by the availability of financial and emotional support resources.

However, research has not established the degree to which such ''experientially similar'' others benefit caregivers. We analyzed data from a study of 254 individuals earing for relatives with Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder and 2,659 members of their social networks. The presence of experientially similar individuals in the caregivers' social networks was strongly associated with lower levels of depression, especially for persons in more stressful caregiving situations. We discuss possible explanations for this effect, and suggest implications of the findings for future research and practice.

To explain the linguistic complexity of the island, this article reconstructs both its social history (using censuses, church records, and land registries) and its economic history, analyzing the effects of economic change on the island's population. The two offshoot communities on St. Thomas provide evidence of social fragmentation related to occupational differences. Functional explanations for St. Earth's linguistic diversity are inadequate; however, the social network theory of Milroy & Milroy 1992 proves useful in explaining the persistence of language differences in this small isolated community.

Relative deprivation theories propose that a person's socioeconomic situation is related to political violence, but only if the individual's situation is seen relative to other individuals and groups in society. Unfortunately, most tests of this premise have been inconclusive. To a large extent, the problem centers on the lack of appropriate data; relative deprivation theories posit a relationship between the individual and the context, requiring that we merge individual-level and collective-level data. This study examines individuals' socioeconomic positions within the context of their neighborhoods. Two contextual effects are identified. First, consistent with theories of relative deprivation, support for violence is partly determined by the relationship between individual-level and neighborhood-level economic conditions. For instance, poor persons who reside in relatively well-off neighborhoods are highly supportive of violence. Second, the level of socioeconomic heterogeneity within a neighborhood moderates a person's perceptions of deprivation, and consequently this person's support for political violence. These findings suggest that perceptions of deprivation originate through a complex process centering on socioeconomic information from individuals' social contexts.

An introduction to Markov graphs and p	PSYCHOMETRIKA			English	Article						categorical data analysis; social network analysis; random graphs	STATISTICAL-ANALYSIS; DIRECTED-GRAPHS	Spanning nearly sixty years of research, statistical network analysis has passed through (at least) two generations of researchers and models. Beginning in the late 1930's, the first generation of research dealt with the distribution of various network statistics, under a variety of null models. The second generation, beginning in the 1970's and continuing into the 1980's, concerned models, usually for probabilities of relational ties among very small subsets of actors, in which various simple substantive tendencies were parameterized. Much of this research, most of which utilized log linear models, first appeared in applied statistics publications. But recent developments in social network analysis promise to bring us into a third generation. The Markov random graphs of Frank and Strauss (1986) and especially the estimation strategy for these models developed by Strauss and Ikeda (1990; described in brief in Strauss, 1992), are very recent and promising contributions to this field. Here we describe a large class of models that can be used to investigate structure in social networks. These models include several generalizations of stochastic blockmodels, as well as models parameterizing global tendencies towards clustering and centralization, and individual differences in such tendencies. Approximate model fits are obtained using Strauss and Ikeda's (1990) estimation strategy. In this paper we describe and extend these models and demonstrate how they can be used to address a variety of substantive questions about structure in social networks.

In addition biographic data and information of the present problems as well the judgement of the therapists were registered. The results show that the subjective concepts of problem attribution and treatment expectations correlate with patient variables as personality, social economic states, social network, anamnestic data, present problems, previous therapeutic experience and vocational situation. Some concepts (e.g. psychologically oriented concepts) and the conformity of therapists and patients are important predictors of indication, prognosis and outcome of therapy. Therapists are especially motivated to work with patients who have similiar concepts and a similiar social background as themselves. The concepts of the patients assimilate of those of the therapists already after a short period of therapy.

Design: Descriptive, retrospective. Method: Data were collected by means of anonymous questionnaires sent to a random sample of 521 general practitioners (GPs) in the Province of North Holland and 521 GPs from the rest of the Netherlands and all 713 Dutch nursing home physicians (NHPs). The data were collected over the period 1986 to June 1990 inclusive. Results: GPs and NHPs had discussions most often with the partner of the patient about the patient's request for EAS, the doctor's intention to administer EAS and the actual administering of EAS. According to both the GPs and the NHPs the social network practically always agreed with the doctor's decision to administer EAS. The persons who were most often present at the patient's bedside when EAS was administered were the patient's partner and children (29%). Often, especially in the cases of GPs, the decision not to report EAS was determined by the desire of relatives and/or the physician not to involve the relatives in a judicial inquiry. Conclusion: To a large extent the social network was involved in the patient's request for EAS, the doctor's intention to administer EAS and the actual administering of EAS. This seems to be important both for good decision-making with regard to EAS and for helping relatives to come to terms with the loss of a dear one.

The relatively spontaneous, peaceful revolution that toppled the communist regime cannot be fully explained by the prevailing theories of revolution and collective action. While both structurally oriented and identify-oriented theory offers insight into the revolutionary process, neither are completely satisfactory. Most theories assume a relatively open field of political contestation and conditions of relative social freedom that were absent in East Germany. I suggest a synthetic, historically specific approach in which collective identities are situated with small-scale social networks. The crucial factors in making the revolution possible were! shared grievances and the expectation of social solidarity. Though they were politically subordinated, ordinary East Germans expressed grievances and nurtured opposition in small circles of confidants.

In this paper we will consider only problems of cultural ageing in industrial Western society and especially in some OECD countries. There, demographic changes have been characterised by ageing of populations, visible since the fifties, by feminization of later life and modifications of social network. Ageing of population including the oldest generations have made definitions of later life more politicised and have gone together with new attitudes towards ageing and elderly people giving rise to different patterns of ageism. Examination of incomes, health status, social support of the elderly shows that until today there have been persistent inequalities related to age, gender and social class in terms of resources, access to informal and formal care and value accorded to later life. These inequalities are due to differences in status and resources of elderly and trajectories of ageing, always conditioned by social locations: position in labour market and in domestic division of labour with resulting social relations. The differences vary also between countries according to their welfare regime and their social policy. In the future, the proportion of those over 65 of age and among them of those over 80 will be greater raises the questions of health status of the oldest generations, income distribution among generations and genders, of access to informal and formal care anc: adequacy of the later for the frail elderly. To cope with those issues ageing and later life should be considered in a life-span perspective. Better sharing of jobs and of economic wealth, development of meaningful activities other than work may be solutions to answer to the questions addressed by an ageing population and the problems of later life.

A cohort of all children born in the region of Sundsvall was followed. The Cox regression model was used. The population increased 12-fold in the sawmill parish, and doubled in the other parishes. Every 13th child lost either his or her mother or father. The death risk represented by being a motherless infant exceeded every other death risk for the child, and was further enhanced if parents were crofters or coming from the sawmill parish. For children beyond the age of I year, factors other than parental deprivation became decisive. Stepparents had an immense positive influence on the survival of the children. The social network worked relatively well for those children who were orphans beyond the age of 1 year. The motherless infants had the worst outcome. The best chance for survival was found for children with step-parents.

Predictors of outcome were examined at 18 months post-treatment entry for 353 admissions to methadone maintenance who received random assignment to one of three counseling conditions: (1) medication only, (2) standard counseling and (3) enhanced services; and one of two contingency conditions: (1) no contingencies, and (2) contingency contracting in a six-cell 3 x 2 design. Subjects in contingency contracting conditions were placed on contingency contracts for positive urine toxicology results and ultimately discharged for unremitting drug use. All subjects completed the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and provided weekly urine specimens. Predictors of urinalysis results and treatment retention were determined using bivariate and multivariate techniques. Interactions between subject characteristics by experimental condition assignment were also examined as predictors. Higher rates of total positive urine specimens were predicted by younger age, greater pre-treatment frequency of smoking cocaine, lower ASI psychiatric composite scores, and higher ASI legal composite scores. Higher rates of opiate positive specimens were predicted by younger age, lower pre-treatment frequency of alcohol intoxication, higher ASI legal and lower ASI employment and psychiatric composite scores, and assignment to medication only/no contingencies condition. Higher rates of cocaine positives were predicted by younger age, black race, lower ASI psychiatric composite score, greater pre-treatment frequency of intravenous and smoked cocaine use, less pre-treatment frequency of marijuana use, and lower methadone dose level. Assignment to enhanced/contingency contracting predicted lower rates of cocaine positives. Treatment retention was predicted by older age, non-black race, lower ASI legal composite score, higher methadone dose level and assignment to non-contingent conditions. While subject variables over which treatment providers have little control were, thus, related to outcome, type of treatment provided and methadone dose also influenced outcome.

In addition, reconciliation frequency seems to covary with other social variables such as the rate of allogrooming, the intensity of aggression and the outcome of approaches: the 'systematic variation' hypothesis. It is proposed that such systematic variation should be present not only between different species but also between different groups of the same species. To test these hypotheses, data were collected from two large corral-housed groups of pigtail macaques, Macaca nemestrina, over 7 months. The two groups lived in identical environments but one was well established, the other newly formed. In both groups, conflicts were more frequently reconciled between opponents with strong affiliative ties, as predicted by the relationship quality hypothesis. Members of the well-established group reconciled roughly twice as often as members of the newly formed group. Contrary to the predictions of the systematic variation hypothesis, other social variables did not vary between groups. Members of the well-established group, however, distributed their affiliative behaviour less evenly, focusing their efforts on a relatively small number of partners. The concentrated social networks in the well-established group apparently produced more intense ties, hence increasing the likelihood of reconciliation after conflict. These results show that detailed analyses of social networks provide a tool to investigate the systematic variation hypothesis when variation is subtle, such as between groups of the same species. The study confirms the relationship quality hypothesis at both the within- and between-group level, provides support for a more sophisticated concept of systematic variation, and illustrates the special usefulness of reconciliation measures as a gauge of social integration.

The study focuses on the neighbourhood as a potential source of support for families, the study design emphasizing the character of the neighbourhoods as social entities. The social character and reported child abuse histories of the two study neighbourhoods in Western Sydney, Australia, are presented, and the research instruments and procedures used in a household survey, are described. Demographic data, parents'/carers' ratings of (i) the social environment, (ii) the locality as a place to raise children, (iii) transport and communication patterns, together with membership of nine sub-networks of each carer's support network, are analysed. The one outstanding difference between the two localities was found to be the structure of the networks of the two samples of residents. In the area with a higher rate of abuse there was a relative lack of connection between more immediate (familial) and more distant parts of the social networks, a finding which parallels the results of several earlier studies of clinical and non-clinical populations.

DATA SOURCES: Psyclit and Sociofile were searched for September 1979 through December 1994. STUDY SELECTION: All publications covering social support, social networks and rehabilitation from CAD as well as large mortality studies. Fifty-one articles were reviewed. DATA EXTRACTION: Original articles were summarized. DATA SYNTHESIS: Individuals who benefit from social support are less likely to become disease-stricken and live longer than those with less support. Social support and networks may have a substantial influence on the speed and quality of recovery following myocardial infarction (MI). CONCLUSIONS: A review of the literature indicates that social support plays an important role in recovery from and adaption to chronic disease such as CAD and is of equal importance to the primary and secondary prevention of MI. Future research should pay special attention to what types of functional support are of most importance to recovery from MI and bypass surgery, thus allowing for the development of rehabilitation programs and interventions that will emphasize functions that are most needed.

Hypotheses predicting group differences in acculturation stress were tested. Analyses were bivariate and multivariate, using parent and adolescent data. Findings indicated important differences in acculturation stress for different cohorts of immigrants within the two ethnic groups as well as differences between the subsamples. Important differences were also found between adolescent and parental acculturation stress, with more recent immigrants among the adolescents experiencing more language conflicts, while parents reported more long-term language conflicts. Adolescent and parental acculturation-related stressors and acculturation levels were strongly associated with lower levels of family cohesion, increased parent/child acculturation conflicts, adolescent self-esteem and adolescent perceived teacher derogation. The differences and similarities found between the Cuban and Nicaraguan groups, parents and adolescents, are discussed with a focus on the importance of the family as a coping source for the stresses associated with immigrant adaptation.

We prospectively analyzed the influence of demographic, medical, and pathophysiologic factors on admission delay in 1,197 unselected, acute stroke patients. Twenty five percent were admitted within 3 1/2 hours, 35% within 6 hours, 50% within 14 hours, and 68% within 24 hours after stroke onset. Living alone (odds ratio [OR] 1.75, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3) and retired working status (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.54) delayed admission. A well-working social network thus seems important to early admission. The milder the stroke, the higher was the risk of delayed admission (OR 1.25 per 10 points decrease in stroke severity [Scandinavian Neurological Stroke Scale score on admission], 95% CI 1.14 to 1.3). A history of TIA increased the relative chance of early admission by odds 1.64 (95% CI 1.06 to 2.54). Other factors such as age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, other comorbidity, previous stroke, headache, aphasia, apraxia, anosognosia, neglect, lowered consciousness, mental status (Mini-Mental State Examination) and type of stroke (hemorrhage infarct) had no independent influence on admission time. Admission was markedly delayed in most patients. This represents a major barrier to medical treatment. Patients with the most severe strokes are admitted early, but patients with milder symptoms should also be encouraged to seek immediate admission. The observation that a history of TIA reduced admission time indicates that an increase in public awareness and knowledge may reduce delay and save precious time.

The ordered-network approach gives rise to a novel means of graphing the social field of kinship relations, while allowing kinship to be locally defined in culturally relative terms. Its utility is exemplified in applications to kinships among US Presidents, Old Testament Canaanites, and native Australians of Groote Eylandt. The formal concepts treated in the mapping of kinship networks are: kinship axioms, parental graph structure, core, circuits of consanguineally and affinally linked kin, sides and divides, homeomorphic mappings, homomorphisms as potentially simplifying mappings of kinship, elementary structure, and order-structure. Representational theorems are proven about homeomorphisms, cores and circuits, and the ambiguity of elementary structures. The last set of theorems leads to clarifying and redefining some of the basic concepts of elementary, semi-complex and complex structures of kinship in terms of properties of generationally ordered networks. The conclusions of the formal argument are 'post-structural' in the narrow sense of demonstrating the need for specifying contingent historical processes in the structural analysis of kinship as a social field. The open-ended approach to change, one that is implied by the study of ordered structures that unfold in a temporal succession, connects to issues of population variability, selection, and evolutionary processes. The kinship structures that are mapped in this approach are not intended as any sort of complete representations of kinship 'systems', but merely as scaffoldings that help to bring into view kinship as a social field, providing a baseline for other mappings (which may be superimposed) of social processes such as communicative fields, exchange processes, transmission of learned behaviors, social rights and inheritance, political and religious succession, and the like.

Key components of mismatch. such as human capital attributes and access to automobile commuting, do appear to influence employment likelihoods among native disadvantaged minorities, but have little effect on immigrants, The latter consistently exhibit high employment rates. The interpretation offered rests on two factors. First the data support the idea that immigrants' social networks largely underlie their impressive work records. In addition, the data provide limited support to the explanation, strongly indicated in the literature, that immigrants are favored by employers for their exploitability and that such preferences are expressed via hiring techniques that utilize the immigrants' social networks.

Soc. Sci. Med. 32, 847, 1991; Soc. Sci. Med. 33, 1155, 1991; Environ. Plan. A. 26, 767, 1994; Wallace R. and Fullilove M. Environ. Plan. A. 23, 1701 1991). Here we reanalyze the problem in probability space and recover a close analog of the Shannon Coding Theorem of information theory. Subsequent direct application of information-theoretic methods provides striking insight regarding the spread of disease along the sociogeographic networks of marginalized subgroups, suggesting that 'risk behaviors' for infection may constitute essential components of a behavioral code for the transmission of information within the noisy channel of a marginalized community's social networks. The code's form, including the incorporation of risk behaviors, arises as a direct consequence of the external oppressive forces which structure marginalization. This viewpoint suggests an explanation of the sometime-observed rapid transmission of both infection and of control strategies for infection along the same network, but suggests further that if risk behaviors are indeed parts of a behavioral code for the transmission of group norms, statements of individual worth or resource sharing, then high rates of relapse are inevitable, given the persistence of the external oppression which gives those behaviors symbolic value. We suggest that violent acts in particular may emerge as key behavioral symbols for 'sending a message' in socially disorganized communities, implying that school-based or other individual-oriented harm reduction strategies for violence prevention, in the absence of a comprehensive, multifactorial reform program, cannot significantly reverse the effects of continuing economic and social constraints or of public policies of planned shrinkage and benign neglect, factors primarily responsible for the disorganization of urban minority communities within the United States.

This growth is due to importation of artificial intelligence techniques into methodological tools for data analysis, a growing interest among researchers in artificial intelligence in the socially situated agent, and a growing interest among sociologists in using artificial intelligence techniques for theorizing about social phenomena. Increasingly, researchers are addressing concerns of traditional importance within sociology, such as the bases for cooperation, the role of structure in affecting individual agency, and interaction using computational models of intelligent adaptive agents. This article provides an overview of the role that artificial intelligence currently plays within sociology.		Carley, KM (reprint author), CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV,PITTSBURGH,PA 15213, USA.

After adjusting for baseline successful aging, sex, and age, the authors found that 1984 predictors of 1990 successful aging included income above the lowest quintile (odds ratio (OR) = 2.01, 95% confidence interval (Cl) 0.99-4.11), greater than or equal to 12 years of education (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.98-2.84), white ethnicity (OR = 2.12, 95% Cl 0.93-4.86), diabetes (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.79), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.97), arthritis (OR = 0.43, 95% CI 0.26-0.71), and hearing problems (OR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.25-0.89). Adjusting for all variables, the authors found that behavioral and psychosocial predictors included the absence of depression (OR = 1.94, 95% CI 1.10-3.42), having close personal contacts (OR = 1.82, 95% CI 1.05-3.18), and often walks for exercise (OR = 1.77, 95% CI 1.00-3.12). Cross-sectional comparisons at follow-up revealed significantly higher community involvement, physical activity, and mental health for those aging successfully.

He expects high-status culture to be useful in class because it is correlated with class, but culture used at work includes both genres related to class (used in domination) and genres unrelated to class (used in coordination). High-status culture is correlated with class but excluded, not used, in the competitive private sector. The most widely useful cultural resource is cultural variety, and social network variety is a better source of cultural variety than is class itself.

Results revealed that homeless mothers were in significantly less contact with their friends/relatives, could count on fewer people for help and child care in times of need, and felt their social networks were less helpful in raising their families than housed mothers. Further, longer stays in homelessness were predictive of less helpful social networks, which may hinder a family's return to permanent housing. Implications of these findings and recommendations for family service providers are discussed.

Beginning in 1988, 641 HIV-seronegative IDUs were recruited by targeted sampling methods to reflect broader IDU populations and were followed for 4 years (1988-1992). All were active injectors not in treatment when recruited. Cohort members were targets of HIV-prevention outreach. The intervention was guided by the Indigenous Leader Outreach Model: Exaddicts deliver HIV-prevention services targeting IDU social networks in community settings. Primary outcome measures were HIV seroconversion and HIV risk behaviors. Observed incidence of HIV infection decreased, from 8.4 to 2.4 per 100 person-years. Prevalence of drug risk behaviors also decreased, from 100 to 14%. Seroconversion was associated with injection risk behavior [risk ratio (RR) = 9.8]. Sex risk behavior also decreased, but less dramatically, from 71 to 45%. Out-of-treatment IDUs in Chicago have reduced their rates of new HIV infection by reducing their injection risk behavior.

Data are reported on two county-based child mental health systems in North Carolina that participated in the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Mental Health Services Program for Youth. Analyses are based on a structural equivalence approach which groups organizations on the basis of similarity in their patterns of interaction. Site-specific data were collected at two time points (1991 and 1993) to measure the social network structure of these service systems including their density, fragmentation, and centralization. Findings indicate that two interesting changes occurred in these systems of care. First, each system moved in a direction consistent with the goals of the RWJF demonstration program, in that they were better organized by the end of the demonstration. Second, while the two systems started at very different levels of system development, one site made significantly larger gains, such that the systems converged over time toward moderately high levels of system organization at the end of the demonstration. Implications for further research are discussed. (C) 1996 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

African-Americans were more likely to report symptoms of anger, irritability, denial of illness, and to spontaneously report symptoms that did not reflect a change in mood, but rather forbearance of a difficult time or somatic complaints. This paper describes the results of a study to assess the presence of depressive symptoms in older African-American community residents. Anew instrument, the Baker Belief Scale, is compared with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D) and the association of medical illnesses, social network, and level of physical function in activities of daily Living (ADL). Ninety-six African-American men and women, aged 60 years or older, with equal representation from urban and rural counties in western Tennessee comprised the sample. The sample was stratified, in each of the two counties, into three age categories; 60-69, 70-79, and 80 years and older. A screening battery consisting of the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, the CES-D, the Lubben Social Network Scale, and the Katz ADL were administered to the sample. Current medical illnesses were recorded with demographic data. There was a significant association between the CES-D score and the BBS score for those who screened positive for symptoms of depression. In addition there was a significant relationship between CES-D score and specific medical illnesses, social network, physical function in ADL, and residence (urban vs. rural). Residents who screened positive (N = 19) for depressive symptomatology with CES-D scores of 16 or higher exhibited a higher frequency of hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and circulatory problems than those who tested negative (N = 77). More urban residents (N = 13) than rural residents (N = 6) screened positive for symptoms of depression. Approximately 21% (N = 20) of the 96 respondents had scores of 20 or less on the Lubben Social Network Scale, suggesting a group ''at risk'' for social isolation.

The problem at present, however, is that few effective policy instruments exist to thwart such seepage. Here, therefore, an innovative approach to facilitate local purchasing amongst rural dwellers is evaluated: Local Exchange and Trading Systems (LETS). Reporting empirical evidence from both a national survey of United Kingdom LETS and a membership survey of Totnes LETS in Devon, this paper finds that LETS are rapidly growing in rural areas and are not only encouraging local purchasing but are also rebuilding local social networks and enabling some of those marginalised from employment to gain access to work and credit. As such, they amalgamate both economic and community development. To further improve their effectiveness, several barriers to their development are identified and solutions offered to how these may be overcome. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Untreated, active problem drinkers served as controls. Merited: Subjects (N = 45, with 15 per group; 62% male) were recruited from the community. Habitual drinking practices, social network characteristics, social support, help-seeking barriers and incentives, and event occurrences during the 2 years prior to help-seeking were assessed during structured interviews. Collaterals verified subject reports. Results: Alcohol-related psychosocial problems and social network characteristics specific to drinking and help-seeking differentiated the groups, whereas drinking practices, general measures of social support and event occurrences did not. Both groups who sought help reported less network encouragement to drink, more network encouragement to seek help and greater alcohol-related psychosocial problems compared to untreated problem drinkers. AA participants also received more conflicting messages about seeking help than did treatment participants, and features of AA variously attracted and repelled different problem drinkers. Conclusions: The findings indicate the importance of separating alcohol-specific social influences on help-seeking from more general social contextual variables and provide a social basis for distinguishing the appeal of AA from that of formal treatment. The results generally concur with studies of help-seeking for other medical and psychological disorders and support a common approach that emphasizes the social nature of help-seeking and focuses on functional rather than structural influences.

No significant protective effects were found for network structural or support characteristics. However, greater frequency of instrumental support was associated with significantly increased risk of ADL disability among men; a similar though nonsignificant pattern was seen among women. These findings indicate that receipt of more instrumental support may not have uniformly beneficial effects on functional status. They serve to underscore the need for more comprehensive research, examining both the positive and negative effects of social interactions on health and functioning.

Biological mechanisms must be operative to mediate this influence of social factors on clinical outcome. As increasing age is the common denominator for different categories of chronic disease, the ageing process itself in individuals may be studied in connection with data on exposure to negative psychosocial and lifestyle factors. A hypothesis is stated that premature ageing is the result of social pathology working on human physiology if buffering, health-preserving (salutogenic) mechanisms are not sufficient to counteract this effect. One measurable variable of the ageing process may be melatonin, known to decrease with age and to be lower in patients with coronary heart disease than in normal individuals.

Social parameters in alcoholics	MEDICINE SCIENCE AND THE LAW			English	Article								An investigation was performed on material from deceased from the Copenhagen County, examined at the Institute of Forensic Medicine during the period 1985-1989. The basis and the reliability of the diagnosis of chronic alcoholism in a forensic post-mortem material is discussed. The frequency of alcoholics in the autopsy material varied between 25 per cent and 30 per cent annually. The frequency of women was significantly lower than that of men. The alcoholics were generally younger than controls, they were more often divorced, but cohabited with the same frequency as controls. Both the alcoholics and the controls belonged mainly to the lowest social classes. Alcoholics lived in flats and died in the living room more often than controls. Special attention is given to persons dying in bathtubs and on staircases. The interval between last seen alive' and 'found dead' was significantly longer in alcoholics, signifying loss of social network. Both alcoholics and controls generally lived under poor social conditions, more pronounced in the former.

We find that scientists at the two NBFs enter into large numbers of collaborative research efforts with scientists at other organizations, especially universities. Formal market contracts are rarely used to govern these exchanges of scientific knowledge. bur findings suggest that the use of boundary-spanning social networks by the two NBFs increases both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organization.

In moving to the west, the migrants had to deal with various stressors, among them the lack of social ties in their new environment. Fortunately, the number of their new friends increased steadily, and loneliness declined. These changes, however, differed between sexes and age groups. Men made more friends than women, in particular same-sex friends, whereas women knitted ties with both sexes. The young built larger networks than the intermediate age group. Loneliness emerged as an inhibiting factor in the bonding process. The study demonstrates how well these refugees coped with a social crisis. It also examines the roles that loneliness and social bonding played in the readjustment process.

Data were gathered from 141 pairs of demented persons living in the community and their informal primary caregivers. Analysis of the information reported by the primary caregivers indicated that sense of competence and its component domains were affected above all by behavioural problems of the demented person and degree of neuroticism of the primary caregiver. No significant influence was found on the sense of competence of formal support of home helps and district nurses. The results suggested that the amount of support the demented person received from other social network members only had a limited influence on the domains of sense of competence.

Most important in aural rehabilitation is the fitting of hearing aids. Problematic is the low use of hearing aids by elderly hearing impaired individuals. Therefore, in the present study predictors of hearing aid use will be analyzed. The theory of planned behavior was used in a sample of 54 men and women with presbyacusis (54-87 years old) for the prediction of hearing aid use. The analyses revealed that actual hearing aid use is influenced mainly by the intention to use hearing aids and by normative beliefs of the person. The intention to use hearing aids is influenced mainly by the attitude towards using hearing aids. Practical implications of the results are discussed: Aural rehabilitation possibly can be improved by changing attitudes toward hearing aid use and asking important members of the social network to participate actively in the aural rehabilitation process.

The term was exported from pediatrics in the 1970s and is used to describe older adults with various concurrent chronic diseases, functional impairments, or both. Despite this heterogeneity, failure to thrive has had its own International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) code since 1979 and has been approached as a clinically meaningful diagnosis in many review articles. This conceptual framework, however, can create barriers to proper evaluation and management. The most worrisome of these barriers is the reinforcement of both fatalism and intellectual laziness, which need to be balanced with a deconstructionist approach, wherein the major areas of impairment are identified and quantified and have their interactions considered. Four syndromes known to be individually predictive of adverse outcomes in older adults are repeatedly cited as prevalent in patients with failure to thrive: impaired physical functioning, malnutrition, depression, and cognitive impairment. The differential diagnosis of contributors to each of these syndromes includes the other three syndromes, and multiple contributors often exist concurrently. Some of these contributors are unmodifiable, some are easily modifiable, and some are potentially modifiable but only with the use of resource-intensive strategies. Initial interventions should be directed at easily remediable contributors in the hope of improving overall functional status, because a single contributor may simultaneously influence several other syndromes that conspire to create the phenotype of failure to thrive. How aggressively should more resource-intensive strategies for less easily modifiable contributors be pursued? This is a central clinical, ethical, and policy issue in geriatric medicine that cannot be settled without better process and outcome data. This paper examines the medical etymology of failure to thrive and proposes a rational approach to evaluation and management that is based on the limited medical literature.

A total of 67 younger subjects (under 60 years) and 75 elderly subjects (60 years or above) were interviewed during the third week after the earthquake, and 50 and 73 subjects, respectively, were interviewed during the eighth week. All subjects were assessed using the Post-Traumatic Symptom Scale. During the first assessment, subjects from both age groups experienced sleep disturbances, depression, hypersensitivity and irritability. During the second assessment, the percentage of younger subjects experiencing symptoms did not decrease, while elderly subjects showed a significant decrease in 8 of 10 symptoms. This may have been due to such factors as decreased psychological stress, extensive social networks, and previous disaster experiences in the case of the elderly subjects.

Factor analysis revealed that a multi-dimensional construct which included four factors-media preferences, socio-political awareness, endogamy and social networks-was necessary to operationalize and measure the concept of ethnic identity. Using structural equation modeling, a model was tested which analyzed the impact of ethnic identification on religiosity and drinking norms, which in turn were predictors of drinking and heavier drinking latent variables. The results showed that ethnic identity influenced drinking behavior indirectly through its effects on drinking norms and religiosity as well as directly. Most aspects of ethnic identity decreased drinking levels. Respondents who scored higher on involvement with black social networks and black social and political awareness drank at lower levels than other respondents. These results were attributed to the prevalence of norms for abstinence and high levels of social control regarding drinking in black communities. However, high scores on using black media increased drinking rates. It was suggested that the promotion of alcohol use in black orientated media as well as the social settings attended by those who prefer black media might increase alcohol consumption.

Design: HIV-1 prevalence and HIV testing behaviour were measured in four serial point prevalence surveys of IDU recruited at multiple sites in community-based nontreatment and drug treatment settings between 1990 and 1993. Methods: Community subjects were recruited through social network sampling by trained indigenous interviewers; treatment subjects were interviewed at agencies. With informed consent, subjects responded to a structured questionnaire covering risk behaviour. Volunteered saliva samples were tested anonymously for anti-HIV-1. Statistical comparisons across years were examined using mixed binomial logistic and loglinear models. Pearson's chi(2) and Fisher's exact tests were also used for some two-group comparisons. Results: Similar samples were recruited each year. HIV-1 prevalence rate declined from 12.8% in 1990, 9.8% in 1991, 7.0% in 1992, to 6.9% in 1993. The statistical modelling suggested that the overall trend in prevalence rates was one of decelerating decline. There was no difference in prevalence rate by gender and length of injecting. Less than one-half (46%) had received a named HIV test. Over one-half of the HIV-positive IDU were unaware of their status. Conclusions: The pattern of decline in HIV-1 prevalence rate is attributed to changes in risk behaviour following HIV prevention interventions.

injection drug users; human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); social networks; prevention; experimental intervention	AIDS-RISK BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL NETWORKS; REDUCTION; INFECTION; ALCOHOL; PROGRAM	Social influence processes have been found to affect numerous drug and health-related behaviors. We postulated that by using a network-oriented intervention it may be possible to capitalize on social influence processes to reduce human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors. The present study used an experimental study design for delivering a psychoeducational acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) preventive intervention to injection drug soaring networks. Participants were recruited from the ALIVE study, an epidemiological study in Baltimore. In the present paper we examine the self-reported behavioral outcomes of 117 injection drug users 18 months after the baseline interview HIV seronegative experimental participants reported significantly less frequent needle sharing and less injecting of heroin and cocaine than controls. In multiple logistic regression models of HIV seronegative participants, there was a significant negative association between assignment to the experimental group and the HIV-related behaviors of needle snaring and sharing of cookers in the prior 6 months; controls were 2.8 times more likely than experimentals to report needle sharing and were 2.7 times more likely to report sharing cookers. The results of this 18-month follow-up suggest that among injection drug users network-oriented interventions may be a promising approach to HIV prevention.

Newly diagnosed cancer patients (n = 51) were followed for 1 year. Semistructured personal interviews and questionnaires were used to gather data. On the average, patients' functioning improved and the amount of physical complaints decreased over the year. Psychological complaints decreased over the year. Psychological complaints and the global evaluation of life, however, did not change significantly over time. The patients were supported by small, dense networks, consisting mostly of family members. Size of the networks as well as the amount of emotional support showed some decrease over time. It appeared that emotional support was positively related to quality of life. Moreover, a tendency was found to indicate that patients with a deterioration in quality of life perceived a larger decrease in emotional support than patients with a positive course. The amount of perceived instrumental support did not change significantly. There is a tendency that patients who were functioning worse had a greater need for instrumental support. Although these findings indicate relations between types of support and quality of life, we cannot make statements on the causality of these relations.

Subscales tapping 5 friendship processes (e.g., validation, aid, disclosure of negative affect, exclusivity, conflict) were extracted from a 24-item friendship interview that was individually administered to 82 kindergarten children (M age = 5.61) who possessed a reciprocated and stable ''best'' friend in their classroom. Children's reports of the investigated friendship processes were found to be reliable, and processes such as perceived validation and conflict predicted children's satisfaction with their friendships, and the stability of these these relationships. Perceived conflict in friendships was associated with multiple forms of school maladjustment for boys, including higher levels of school loneliness and avoidance and lower levels of school liking and engagement. For both boys and girls, validation and aid forecasted gains in perceived support from classmates, and aid also predicted improvements in children's school attitudes. Perceived exclusivity in friendships was associated with lower levels of achievement. These findings, and others reported in this article, are consistent with the hypothesis that the relational features of children's classroom friendships yield psychological benefits or costs (e.g., provisions) that, in turn, affect their development and adjustment.

Basing our study on a comparative analysis of the locational, sectoral, and organizational characteristics and performance variation of industrial firms invested by overseas Chinese and other foreign capital, we posit that effective manipulation of state action holds a key to the economic success of foreign-invested firms in post-Mao China. The role of social networks in influencing the selection and outcomes of foreign investors' strategies, which is emphasized by some existing studies, should be assessed not only in terms of its importance to market transactions, but more importantly, in terms of its utility in gaining ad hoc redistributive advantages and minimizing or containing unfavorable treatments from the still potent yet increasingly porous and localized state apparatus. Disaggregate data from a national industrial firm data set and a survey on the investment activities of Hong Kong manufacturers in China are used to test hypotheses derived from case-study findings with respect to three existing perspectives on the subject.

Radiographic examination had been undertaken in 92% of the residents, with on an average 16 examinations per resident. The most common examinations were of the chest in 63% of the residents followed by lower limb (58%) and spine (52%) examinations. In men the total number of radiographic examinations were negatively correlated to income, intelligence test results and social network and job satisfaction. Men with monotonous work and a more restricted latitude for decision-making at work, as well as men who were smokers had also had significantly more radiographic examinations. Single civil status and occupational work load had in men a positive correlation with the total number of radiographic examinations, as well as with serum levels of glutamyltransferase and uric acid levels. In women there was a negative correlation between radiographic examinations and teachers' rating of intelligence in childhood and bone mineral content, whereas job satisfaction, life success and triceps skinfold index (= subcutaneous fat tissue thickness) had a positive correlation with the total number of radiographic examinations. Women who took regular exercise (every week) had had significantly fewer radiographic examinations. Men and women with locomotor discomfort bad a significantly higher consumption of not only musculoskeletal radiographic examinations but also other radiographic examinations.

Diminished worlds? The geography of everyday life with HIV/AIDS	HEALTH & PLACE			English	Article						HIV/AIDS; daily geography; social networks		This paper examines the impact of HIV/AIDS upon the geography of everyday life using insights gained from an ethnographic study of nine men with symptomatic HIV and AIDS in Los Angeles. Variations among respondents and their immediate environments produce different experiences following diagnosis. Despite these variations, there exist some striking similarities in the impact of the illness. These similarities are conceptualized using a stage model to illustrate the changing effect of the illness upon the geographical dimensions of respondents' lives. Respondents' lives were fundamentally altered by HIV/AIDS, but not all changes were detrimental. The complex nature of the illness engenders a series of both positive and negative shifts in well-being, which, in turn, produces expansion as well as decline of people's daily worlds.

Traditional theories of media use have proposed that perceptions of media use are shaped by individuals' demographic characteristics and the media's characteristics. However three recent theories-critical mass theory social influence model of media use, and adaptive structuration theory-suggest that individuals' perceptions of media emerge as a result of their interaction with others in their social network. Results from a longitudinal study of 30 group decision support system (GDSS) groups and 25 non-GDSS groups over a 3-week period indicate that interactional influence was a better predictor of individuals' perceptions of media use than were individuals' demographic characteristics or characteristics of the media.

Kin support to young mothers, while beneficial, should not be romanticized. It also often entails conflict, stress, frustration, and disappointment due to interpersonal tensions, or conflicting interests, or relatives' limited ability to provide support. Nearly always the underlying issue is a discrepancy between the young mother's expectations and her support network's performance. We describe three sources of unrealistic expectations: relatives' initial reactions to her pregnancy, a history of early childbearing by relatives, and desires for a relationship with baby's father.

Up to now virtually nothing is known about the social network from the child's viewpoint. In order to evaluate whether drawing a structured social network map (the Five Field Map) could serve as a way of elucidating important aspects of the social world of children, the maps of different samples of children were studied. In a school class of 27 children, aged 11 years, a test-retest study was undertaken. The essential aspects of the map showed good stability over time. The map was compared with other instruments of social interaction in different samples. Predicted associations were found in the nonclinical samples. Aspects of the map measuring dissatisfaction, negative contacts, and conflicts were found to be associated with behaviour problems. The closeness factor of the map and reported dissatisfaction and conflicts differentiated a normal group of children living in single-parent families from a similar group of children with psychiatric problems, The Five Field Map contributes important knowledge about how children perceive their social world. It can thus be considered a suitable instrument to describe the social network from the child's point of view.

The aim of this study war to analyze the relationship between sociodemographic variables, socioeconomic status social network, health, and physician visits and the use of psychotropic drugs among the elderly living at home. The study area was a municipality in mideastern Sweden with a population of about 21,000 inhabitants. Data from interviews with and health assessments of noninstitutionalized people age 75 and older (N = 421) were linked to cut individual-bared research register of prescription drug purchases. There were no differences in psychotropic drug use between men and women or between different age groups. The multivariate analyses (LISREL) showed that mental health and physician visits were associated with psychotropic drug use. An indirect relationship was also found between psychotropic drugs and loneliness and chronic morbidity, respectively.

Five hundred and seventy-nine individuals were recruited in two towns, one of 50,000 and one of 10,000 population. Three approaches to intervention were tested, These approaches included: (1) an intensive outreach program using indigenous outreach workers providing reinforcement of an HIV risk reduction program, and (2) a low intensity outreach program combined with a more intensive office-based HIV risk reduction program, Both conditions were compared with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) recommended standard intervention, Each of the enhanced interventions produced a reduction in HIV-related risk taking reported by the participants. The intensive outreach combined with office intervention and the intensive office intervention without outreach reinforcement each produced significant reductions in sexual risk taking in active drug users, beyond the reductions reported for the NIDA standard program, The enhanced risk reduction programs produced differential impacts for males and females, respectively, between the two high and low intensity outreach models.

This study aimed to examine prospectively the relationships between social networks and total and cause specific mortality, as well as cardiovascular disease incidence. Design - This was a four year follow up study in an ongoing cohort of men, for whom information on social networks was collected at baseline. The main outcome measures were total mortality, further categorised into deaths from cardiovascular disease (stroke and coronary heart disease), total cancer, accidents/suicides, and all other causes; as well as stroke and coronary heart disease incidence. Participants - Altogether 32 624 US male health professionals aged 42 to 77 years in 1988, who were free of coronary heart disease, stroke, and cancer at baseline. Results - A total of 511 deaths occurred during 122 911 person years of follow up. Compared with men with the highest level of social networks, socially isolated men (not married, fewer than six friends or relatives, no membership in church or community groups) were at increased risk for cardiovascular disease mortality (age adjusted relative risk, 1.90; 95% CI 1.07, 3.37) and deaths from accidents and suicides (age adjusted relative risk 2.22; 95% CI 0.76, 6.47). No excess risks were found for other causes of death. Socially isolated men were also at increased risk of stroke incidence (relative risk, 2.21; 95% CI, 1.12, 4.35), but not incidence of non-fatal myocardial infarction. Conclusions - Social networks were associated with lower total mortality by reducing deaths from cardiovascular disease and accidents/suicides. Strong social networks were associated with reduced incidence of stroke, though not of coronary heart disease. However, social networks may assist in prolonging the survival of men with established coronary heart disease.

In contrast, this research views caregiving as a process of mutual exchange. It tests the hypothesis that how much support a mentally ill family member receives depends on how much support they provide to other family members. We also examine whether or not reciprocity depends oil the role relationship between recipients and providers of care, the level of patient symptomatology, coresidence, and several sociodemographic characteristics. The sample indicates 66 patients who have at least one sampled parent or sibling. The results indicate that the amount of support patients give parents and siblings is very strongly associated with how much support they receive from family members. In comparison to the other variables considered here, patient support provision is by far the best predictor of the amount of family support. These results indicate that it is worthwhile to examine caregiving in families with a member who is seriously mentally ill as a process of mutual exchange.

Mutuality (a Q-correlation, reflecting self-other agreement between a self-description and a description provided by an important other) increased with age and was higher for girls. Extraversion and Emotional Stability were not related to mutuality, Agreeableness and Conscientiousness were related to mutuality at age 12, and Openness was related to mutuality at both ages, Mutuality was further related to competence indices at both ages. Mutuality with the main interaction partner in a setting was the most important for competence in that specific setting. These results illustrate the important role for the development of competence of the communication with significant interaction partners and of the adolescent's embeddedness in a social network.		vanAken, MAG (reprint author), UNIV NIJMEGEN,DEPT DEV PSYCHOL,POB 9104,NL-6500 HE NIJMEGEN,NETHERLANDS.

The interview also included measures of grief, burden, coping strategies self efficacy, mastery and social support. Logistic regression was used to compare participants to non-participants. Support group participants were more likely to be a parent with a higher functioning ill relative who has been ill for a longer period of time. Support group participants reported less subjective burden, smaller social networks, and greater utilization of adaptive coping strategies than non-participants.

George to develop a multifactorial model of predictors of depression among aging persons with schizophrenia living in the community. Methods: The SHORT-CARE and the Network Analysis Profile, along with supplemental items, were administered to 117 outpatients age 55 and older who received DSM-III-R diagnoses of schizophrenia before age 45. Bivariate and multivariate analyses examined associations between 27 variables derived from George's model and the presence of depression, A cutoff score for the depression scale of the SHORT-CARE was used to detect clinically significant depression. Results: Forty-four percent of the sample had probable pervasive depression. Bivariate analysis indicated that 16 variables were significantly associated with depression, and logistic regression showed that six variables were strong predictors, Depression was associated with the presence of positive symptoms, physical limitations interfering with activities, younger age, diminished linkage of members of the social network, lower income, and a smaller proportion of social network members who provided sustenance such as food and money. An Ii-variable model correctly classified 81 percent of cases. Conclusions: The level of depression among older outpatients with schizophrenia is approximately one and a half to three times the level in the general older population. Depression in this patient group is associated with nonclinical variables that are independent of psychoses and that resemble patterns found among general older populations, Several of the variables are potentially alterable and therefore afford opportunities to enhance the well-being of persons with schizophrenia who live in the community.

Self-system interpretive mechanisms are considered mediators of the effects of physical health on psychological well-being and include social comparisons, social integration, and illness perceptions. Young-old (aged 60-74) and old-old (75+) women, diagnosed with osteoarthritis (N = 102) or breast cancer (N = 86), who volunteered for the study were interviewed using structured self-report scales. Young-old and old-old women did not differ in terms of health status, interpretive mechanisms, or on three of five indices of psychological well-being. On the other hand, women with arthritis, regardless of age, reported more functional health problems, more symptoms, and perceived their illness as more severe, more chronic, and less controllable than women with breast cancer. Although women with arthritis and breast cancer differed significantly in terms of physical health, they did not differ on multiple measures of psychological well-being. For both groups, women who made more positive social comparisons and who had more extensive social networks had higher levels of psychological well-being, regardless of physical health problems.

RESEARCH ON AGING			English	Article							ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FAMILY CAREGIVERS; SOCIAL SUPPORT; DEMENTIA SUFFERERS; SPOUSE CAREGIVERS; IMPACT; CARE; PREDICTORS; ADULTS; STRAIN	The poor psychological health of caregivers of the frail aged is examined using the stress paradigm and the crises of decline model of caregiving burden. Whereas stress paradigms generally focus on environmental stressors and individual resources, the crises of decline model conceptualizes stress within the social dynamics of the caregiving dyad. Data from a cross-sectional study of 144 caregivers supported both models. Burden was more likely when the primary caregiver experienced degeneration, conflict, enmeshment, unpreparedness, and unwillingness. Minor psychiatric symptoms were explained in part by burden but also by more traditional stressors (supervisory workload) and resources (physical health, self-esteem, mastery, coping strategies, social network availability). Individualistic interventions to relieve burden and symptoms are justifiable on the basis of this study, but with limits to their likely success-limits imposed by family institutions of care in which primary carers lack experience and feel discomfort with degenerative conditions.

Our results are generally consistent with these predictions. Mie then present evidence for rural diversity by comparing data from residents of a two-parish nonmetropolitan area in southwestern Louisiana to the nonmetropolitan subsample of the GSS. After discussing possible mechanisms for this covariation of spatial and aspatial communities, we conclude by commenting on the potential of network analysis to contribute to the resolution of these and other substantively important problems in rural sociology.

The study has a cross-sectional design. It uses a database from the Survey of Living Conditions of Statistics Sweden, and treats a representative sample of the employed Swedish population (n=13,501), aged between 16 and 65, interviewed over the period 1986-89. The results show that male manual workers report more non-severe and severe illness than non-manual workers, and that manual and lower-level non-manual female workers report more severe illness, but not nonsevere illness, than intermediate/higher-level non-manual working females. The observed class differences in experience of severity of illness are partly explained by the factors investigated (job demands, personal economic difficulties, smoking daily, weak social network) in the case of men, and virtually entirely in the case of women. Other ill-health dimensions, such as self-rated general health and impaired working capacity, prove to be related to severity of illness, the latter being more strongly associated with experience of severe illness than the former irrespective of social class. The results lend support to the hypothesis that manual classes are subjected to what might be called ''double suffering''; they have more long-term illnesses and also experience these illnesses with greater intensity and frequency.

All of them are now deceased; their interview data have been completed with dates of death and causes of death. A measure of survival capacity has been used, based on the endured total mortality risk from examination until death, according to life Cables from Statistics Sweden. Survival analyses were performed by gender on the whole sample and on a number of sub-samples defined by age, health-status, social class, and marital status at examination. Physical health status and activity patterns had the overall most significant effects on subsequent longevity. Among the youngest elderly mental health was, however, even more important as a predictor of survival than was physical health. The impact of most other factors like social networks, mobility, and religiosity was of less magnitude, but their importance varied among sub-samples. Most of the variation in survival, however, remains unexplained.		Ljungquist, B (reprint author), UNIV COLL HLTH SCI,INST GERONTOL,BOX 1038,S-55111 JONKOPING,SWEDEN.

These included sociodemographics, health and health-related factors, physical fitness and working conditions. Data from the Swedish Survey of Living Conditions for the two-year period 1988/89 were used. In this survey a random sample (n = 13,295, response rate 79.4%) of the Swedish population aged 16 years and older was interviewed about health, medication use and related matters, among other things. In all, 35% of the population used analgesics at least once during a two-week period, and analgesic use was more than 50% higher among women than men. Analgesic use was less common among those aged 45-64 years and 65-74 years than those 18-44, after controlling for all other variables. The study showed that self-perceived poor health and pain explain much analgesic use. Analgesic use is further explained by lifestyle, sleeping problems, and health care utilization. Marital status, educational level, socioeconomic status, social network and working conditions were found to de of minor importance.

One year after surgery 76% of the women reported that they were cured (group A, n=34) and 24% that they were improved (group B, n=11). The cured women were significantly younger than the improved women. The duration of urinary leakage before the operation was significantly shorter in group A than in group B. One year post surgery group A reported a significantly decrease in impediments to exert certain tasks due to urine leakage. As concerns leisure time, group A reported a higher level of overall activities before surgery than group B, whereas postsurgery both groups obtained about the same level of activities. Regarding social support, no differences between the groups occurred as concerns attachment. Furthermore, group A women showed a significantly higher degree of adequacy of social integration compared with group B. The majority of the couples could openly discuss sexual matters with their partners and were satisfied with their sexual life. More than half of the interviewed men reported an increase in sexual desire one year after their partners operation. Whereas about every third woman in both groups reported an increase in sexual desire. However, the frequency of intercourse did not change in any groups. In conclusion, this study underlines the importance of social factors in the assessment of the consequences of stress urinary incontinence and its treatment.

The objective of this trial was to evaluate a psychosocial support intervention during pregnancy aimed at improving perinatal health and mothers' psychosocial conditions. The core of the intervention was four to six home visits where emotional support, counseling and strengthening of the woman's social network was provided. Outcomes were measured at 36 weeks of pregnancy, post-partum and 40 days after delivery. The intervention was not successful in either altering women's perception of social support and satisfaction with the reproductive experience, as well as maternal and newborn's health care. It is concluded that although high levels of psychosocial distress during pregnancy may play an independent role in determining adverse pregnancy outcomes, this adverse effect does not appear to be ameliorated by psychosocial interventions conducted only during pregnancy, particularly those of a magnitude that can be realistically implemented (in content and frequency) at public care services in most developing countries.

Hypotheses: Political distrust, personal suffering, ideological intensity, and divergent social locations encourage support for ACT-UP and disruptive political tactics among AIDS activists, with strong mediating effects being exerted by sexual orientation. Methods: The data are based on a 1992 national mail survey of AIDS activists. OLS regression was used to analyze the sample as a whole and the subsamples of gay and straight respondents. Results: Whereas distrust and dissatisfaction had a small impact, personal suffering, ideological commitment, and divergent social locations tended to increase support for disruptive behavior. These relationships differed, however, among gays and straights due to their immersion in disparate social networks and milieus. The results highlight the importance of within-movement heterogeneity.

Patterns of interhousehold transfer of goods and services are described, and the significance of kinship (or familial obligations) in shaping patterns of informal exchange are discussed. Data from a 1990 survey of household and residential organisation in Brisbane are used. Differences in income, labour force participation and the density and character of householders' social networks are considered as factors shaping contemporary interhousehold economic activity. Implications for our understanding of people's economic vulnerability are drawn from the observations.

BRITISH JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; MENTAL-PATIENTS; STAY PATIENTS; TAPS PROJECT; SCHIZOPHRENIA; QUALITY; SUPPORT	The focus of the debate over hospital versus community care for those with severe and enduring mental health problems has shifted somewhat towards ensuring the quality of care provided by services regardless of their location. One factor that is generally assumed to be an important indicator of quality of care is the opportunity for community contact that users of a residential service have. This is illustrated by its inclusion in most instruments designed to assess quality of care in psychiatric services. The present study set out to examine the amount of community contact made by residents of three units of a London psychiatric rehabilitation service. Level of community contact was indeed found to be unrelated to the location of these facilities on a hospital site or in the community. However, interesting differences did emerge across units in the type of community contact made by residents and in the identity of residents' companions on community trips.

Long-stay patients with learning disabilities (n=214) were assessed in hospital and 12 and 24 months after discharge in order to examine the effects of relocation. Method. Each resident acted as his/her own control in a prospective repeated-measures design. Skills and behavioural problems were assessed by keyworkers. Self-perceived quality of life was obtained during interviews with researchers who also completed an environmental checklist of the residents' accommodation. Results. There was little or no change in people's low pre-discharge skill levels. Certain aspects of problem behaviour improved after 12 months, although socially unacceptable behaviour increased slightly. People were less depressed (P less than or equal to 0.01) 12 months after discharge (n=119) and were more satisfied (P less than or equal to 0.05) with their new 'homes' (n=108). There were few changes in the pattern of a activities or the social networks of people 12 months later. Little or no further change in outcomes was reported 24 months after discharge. Conclusions. The implementation of the deinstitutionalisation policy in Northern Ireland has been limited by the predominance of residential and nursing homes and the lack of 'ordinary' accommodation. There is a need for purchasers and providers to give more attention to ways in which the principles of normalisation could be incorporated in the process of contracting and delivering services.

Municipal institutions, notably the courts and the public notariate, handled the huge increase in their caseloads smoothly. Men and women easily rid themselves of devalued and unwanted property inherited from their decreased relatives. People also remade their relationships with other people, as marriages doubled or trebled and as immigrants settled into the fabric of the town. Those who survived the plague, therefore, knew how to recreate the social networks on which they depended for friendship, credit, and assistance, and the crisis itself highlights processes of accommodation characteristic of an open and flexible society.

Also to analyse the influence of personality characteristics. Methods-1306 salespeople answered a self administered questionnaire on job characteristics, exposures, personality characteristics, social network, smoking and drinking habits, and symptoms of the neck, shoulders, and low back. Results-In multivariate analyses, high job demands were related to neck and shoulder symptoms (ORs 1.43-1.47 in the highest exposure groups compared with the lowest), and tendency to become overworked and lack of social support from colleagues were related to back pain (OR 1.81-2.04 in the highest exposure groups compared with the lowest). Lack of variation in the job, low control over time, and high competition were related to neck symptoms, but there was an interaction so that both low control over time and high competition had to be present to increase the OR. Also, driving long distances and sedentary work were related to neck and low back pain, and time spent in the car to shoulder pain (ORs 1.64-2.80 in the three highest groups upsilon the lowest exposure groups). Conclusion-Both psychosocial and physical factors were associated with musculoskeletal symptoms. Many dimensions of the demand-control-support model were associated with symptoms. Only one personality characteristic, tendency to feel overworked, significantly influenced the prevalence of musculoskeletal symptoms.

In this case study we examine a neighborhood, the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, New York, in which there is a concentration of poor people living in close proximity to blue-collar jobs. However, few local residents hold local jobs in the private sector. A survey of local employers revealed that most Red Hook jobs were filled via social networks that exclude local residents. Local residents, particularly African Americans, often lacked the serial capital - connections and references - needed to obtain these jobs. Further, many local employers considered Red Hook residents undesirable employees for a variety of reasons including ''place discrimination'' as well as racial discrimination. By contrast, public sector employers often preferred local residents, although their ability to hire them was limited by formal educational requirements. These findings lead us to question the efficacy of policies, such as ''empowerment zones,'' that assume that bringing jobs closer to where poor people live will necessarily improve their employment opportunities.

The protests occurred in the Federal Republic of Germany during the 1980s. The theoretical concept of mobilization-mediating social networks - called serial relays - was developed and its empirical implications tested in two regions. These localities were similar in terms of social and political context, and also in the extent to which they were subjected to military overflights, but they differed in terms of quantity and quality of protest mobilization. The study focuses empirically and analytically on the meso level of society, which was operationalized by gathering interview and survey data on the affiliations of activists and their acquaintances with various associations an the local level. By advancing to a structural analysis of contacts between networks rather than people, the study goes beyond the commonly applied egocentric perspective. The study concludes that high mobilization was facilitated by decentralized relays that linked protest-generating networks to more traditional parts of the local community.

Likewise, never-married women in the United States were consistently excluded from national fertility surveys prior to 1982 because of the perceived sensitivity of questions about contraceptive use and sexual activities. Data on sexual fertility behavior from all women of reproductive age, regardless of marital status, can provide direct measures of sexual activity and unintended pregnancies, as well as facilitate modeling of social networks underlying the sexual transmission of diseases. China's need for such information, however sensitive, will become more difficult to ignore given increasing pressures to attend to the health needs of their never-married but sexually active population.

Application to social development of captive mangabeys	BEHAVIOURAL PROCESSES			English	Article						multivariate analysis; socialization process; social environment; methodology; non-human primate	GRAY-CHEEKED MANGABEYS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; BEHAVIOR	We hypothesized that, within a primate group, socialization processes are influenced by each group member behaving according to his own social network. Therefore socialization processes would differ in various social environments. In this study, we considered two main socialization processes, the acquisition of a social behavioral repertoire and the development of a network of social relationships, and consequently defined six comprehensive developmental parameters. We analyzed the variability of these parameters using a new multifactorial method, the Principal Components Analysis with Instrumental Variable, PCAIV, derived from the Principal Components Analysis and Multivariate Analyses of Variance. This technique allowed us to jointly represent the influence of the independent variables and the complex relationships between the six dependent variables. The study of the social ontogeny of eight infant mangabeys (Cercocebus albigena), reared in three different social environments, served as an illustration of the use of the new multivariate analysis. A 3-variable-model (age, social environment and sex) significantly explained the variability of the developmental parameters. The results confirmed the importance of social interactions in non-human primate infants' development. The application of multivariate methods to the study of individual social development looks promising for future research.

A total of 513 patients with MI, 178 with UA, 237 with IS, and 928 hospitalised controls were recruited. The odds ratio (OR) of MI for two or more relatives with a positive history of MI was 3.6 (95% CI: 1.8-7.3). Family history of MI was predictive for UA (OR = 5.8; 95% CI: 1.2-28.7), but not for IS. A family history of stroke was more associated with the risk of MI than of IS. After adjustment for known risk factors, the OR of MI for more educated people was 2.1 (1.3-3.6) compared with less-educated people. Large family size seemed to be protective for MI. The effect of major risk factors on MI ranged from additive (diabetes) to multiplicative jointly with high education and family history of MI. A family history of stroke increased IS risk threefold jointly with smoking and hyperlipidemia, and eightfold with diabetes. Besides a family history of MI and IS, in this community a higher educational status seems to better identify groups at increased risk of MI. The joint associations have important preventive implications since by identifying high-risk individuals (for MI and IS) a more careful assessment and control of risk factors amenable to intervention may be performed.

A social network analysis was used to describe adolescent friendship patterns and to compare them across schools and time. Ninth graders (n = 1030) at five high schools identified their friends at Wave I and again one year later. The resulting sets of friendship link; were subjected to social network analysis. The patterns of linkages identified adolescents as clique members, liaisons, and isolates. Clique membership,vas the modal social position pattern, but liaisons and isolates also were well represented. The proportions of adolescents representing each social position varied across schools. In all samples, cliques were homogeneous in gender, race, and mother's educational level, and cliques were largely stable over a one-year time period The possibility that social network characteristics could explain a variety of adolescent differences is discussed.

JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						conduct disorder; urban; rural; epidemiology; substance abuse	ONTARIO CHILD HEALTH; SUBSTANCE USE; ADOLESCENCE; DISORDER; PREVALENCE; BEHAVIOR	Objective: To compare the prevalence of conduct problems (CP) according to level of urbanization and to determine which factors account for the potential difference in prevalence rates. Method: Study 1 used a questionnaire survey of a nationally representative sample of 10,462 Norwegian adolescents. Study 2 used a questionnaire survey of a representative sample of 1,346 adolescents living in Oslo. Self-reported CP included most DSM-III-R criteria for conduct disorder. Results: CP rates were similar in all levels of urbanization, except for the only semimetropolitan city in the country, the capital Oslo, which had CP rates twice those of the rest of the country. This increase rate could not be explained by a series of commonly advocated explanations: family structure and parental practices, social network, socioeconomic status, integration in community activities, religious involvement, and race. However, involvement in ''soft'' drugs and associating with antisocial peers could explain the statistically differential rates. Furthermore, in the Oslo study, adolescents' CP did not vary according to density of population or region within the city. Conclusions: The results support previous studies showing increased rates of CP in urban areas. However, urbanization must pass a certain threshold before it has this effect. Moreover, the lack of support for commonly advocated explanations for the difference between urban and nonurban areas suggests that investigations specifically addressing potential explanations for this difference should be conducted. The results indicate that the increased rates of substance use in highly urbanized areas may account for the difference in CP rates by prolonging and aggravating CP.

After 5 years, the patients were followed up by a personal semistructured interview covering sociodemographic, psychosocial and psychiatric areas. Ten patients (13%) had committed suicide during the follow-up period, the majority within 2 years. They tended to be older at the index attempt admission, and most of them had a mood disorder in comparison with the others. Two patients had died from somatic diseases; Forty-two patients were interviewed, of whom 17 (40%) had reattempted during the follow-up period, most of them within 3 years. Predictors for reattempt were young age, personality disorder, parents having received treatment for psychiatric disorder, and a poor social network. At the index attempt, none of the reattempters had diagnoses of adjustment disorders or anxiety disorders. At follow-up, reattempters had more psychiatric symptoms (SCL-90), and their overall functioning (GAF) was poor compared to those who did not reattempt. All of the reattempters had had long-lasting treatment (> 3 years) as compared to 56% of the others.

After a discussion of why the cognitive-behavioral approach can competently address the goals of couples coping with infertility, three phases of treatment are outlined: assessment, therapy, and closure. Areas for assessment include the individual spouse, the marital relationship, and the familial and social network. Therapeutic components entail identification and validity testing of appraisals and attributions regarding infertility and marriage, redirection of the couple's energies toward alternative sources of satisfaction, communication and problem-solving techniques to facilitate expression of emotions and needs and resolution of the infertility crisis, and improving the couple's sexual relationship.

This study investigated the influence of psychosocial stress, maternal schooling, social support, psychological well-being, alcohol, and smoking on intrauterine growth retardation and premature delivery. Methods. At a Copenhagen university hospital, 2432 pregnant women completed a questionnaire on general health, psychosocial stressors, and sociodemographic characteristics. Results. In 212 cases (8.7%) the women delivered prematurely. Preterm delivery was associated with psychosocial stress (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.14 for each 1-point increase on the psychosocial stressor 5-point scale and 1.92 for the whole scale) and poor school education (adjusted OR = 2.62 for 7-9 years of schooling, 1.91 for 10 years, and 1.0 for 11-13 years). In 152 cases (6.3%), infants had a birthweight below the 10th percentile. Intrauterine growth retardation was associated with smoking, daily drinking, school education, and social network variables. In a multiple logistic regression model, intrauterine growth retardation was associated with smoking habits (adjusted OR = 2.40 for 0-9 cigarettes daily, 2.68 for 10-15 daily, and 2.88 for more than 15 daily). Conclusions. Psychosocial stressors and limited duration of schooling appeared to influence preterm delivery. Smoking habits influenced intrauterine growth retardation.

This theoretical strategy embodies ''E-state structuralism,'' which unites the social psychological formalism of expectation states theory with social network research. Using the development of status hierarchies via differential participation in group discussion, the formal model synthesizes (a) the conceptual structure of Fisek, Berger, and Norman, (b) Balkwell's formula for status effects on probabilities of directed participation, and (c) Fararo and Skvoretz's E-state structuralism model for the formation of dominance structures. After describing this synthesis, the article presents the model in axiomatic form and provides a simulation of its dynamic consequences.

The first focuses on the protective features of perceived social support. In this context, research shows that social support protects individuals from major depressive illness. The second theme emphasizes the idea that social networks are also sources of stressors that increase the risk of onset and recurrence of psychiatric disorders. Research on expressed emotion is prominent in this regard.

The study provided an in-depth description of the the classrooms' social networks, focusing on the social and demographic characteristics that distinguished clusters of students. Findings showed that students formed distinct peer clusters around shared characteristics; particular social characteristics were associated with a student's level of centrality, in the classroom; and student's with exceptionalities were well integrated into the classroom's social structure. Affiliations of students with exceptionalities suggest topics for future research.

The interdisciplinary assessment team usually includes at least three members: a physician, a nurse, and a social worker. Patients who appear to derive the greatest benefit are over age 75, have mild to moderate disabilities, may be at risk of nursing home placement, and may have a poor social network. For optimal effectiveness, assessment must be coupled with a comprehensive therapeutic plan and long-term follow-up.

A conceptualisation of evolutionary influences on children's motivation in the peer group	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT			English	Article							SOCIAL NETWORKS; PERSONALITY; PSYCHOLOGY; PRESCHOOL; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; HYPERACTIVITY; FRIENDSHIPS; PERSPECTIVE; MECHANISMS; ATTACHMENT	This paper presents an evolutionary perspective on children's resource directed behaviour in peer groups. It is argued that reciprocity is theoretically expected to be the fundamental rule of resource exchange in peer relationships of friendship. Children are therefore expected to be attracted to peers who are similar to themselves on a wide variety of traits. These traits are viewed as resources in peer relationships, and individual differences in these traits represent a resource environment for children. In this paper, the resource environment represented by individual differences in several evolved motivational systems will be emphasised. The discussion focuses on such three evolved systems, the sensation seeking/impulsivity system, the human affectional system, and the behavioural inhibition system. It is concluded that individual differences in these systems are important for understanding friendship and sociometric status in children's peer relationships.

Using a prospective design, it examines the ability of premorbid and post-illness health perceptions to predict physical disability independently of medical, psychosocial, and behavioral variables. Participants (N = 254) were a subsample of the New Haven cohort of the Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) project wire Rad survived hospitalization for stroke, myocardial infarction, or hip fracture. Data came from premorbid EPESE interviews, medical records, and interviews at 6 weeks and at 6 months after hospitalization. Health perceptions did not universally decline after the illness. Self-rated health at 6 weeks predicted disability al 6 months, but premorbid self-rated health did not, suggesting that illness-related changes in health perceptions influenced the recovery process. The effects of 6-week self-rated health on disability were independent of physical inactivity. The mechanisms by which health perceptions influence recovery are unclear.

Yet in the absence of personal relationships or the expectation of direct reciprocity, help from weak ties might not be forthcoming or could be of low quality. We examined the practice of distant employees (strangers) exchanging technical advice through a large organizational computer network. A survey of advice seekers and those who replied was conducted to test hypotheses about the viability and usefulness of such electronic weak tie exchanges. Theories of organizational motivation suggest that positive regard for the larger organization can substitute for direct incentives or personal relationships in motivating people to help others. Theories of weak ties suggest that the usefulness of this help may depend on the number of ties, the diversity of ties, or the resources of help providers. We hypothesized that, in an organizational context, the firm-specific resources and organizational motivation of people who provide advice will predict the usefulness of advice. We investigated these theories in a study of employees of a global computer manufacturer. We collected survey and observational data on the relationships between information seekers and information providers; the number, diversity, resources, and motivations of information providers, and subjective ratings of the usefulness of the advice (from both parties in the exchange) and whether or not the advice solved information seekers' problems. We found that information providers gave useful advice and solved the problems of information seekers, despite their lack of a personal connection with the seekers. The data support the main hypotheses and provide some support for resource and diversity explanations of weak tie influence. We discuss how this organization's culture sustained useful information exchange through weak ties.

Psychosocial and financial issues of the Swedish annual level-of-living survey in SCI subjects and controls	PARAPLEGIA			English	Article						spinal cord injury; epidemiology; outcome; complications	DEATH	In a series of articles from the Stockholm Spinal Cord Injury Study (SSCIS), the health status of a near-total regional SCI population comprising 353 subjects has been investigated. The present study describes the psyche-social and financial consequences of SCI in this group. It is based on a level-of-living survey that has been used annually on 8000-14 000 Swedes since 1974. The health-focused version of this survey was used for data collection in the subset of 326 subjects in the SSCIS that were residents of the Greater Stockholm area. The normative material consisted of 1978 interviews of residents of the same area, provided by the Swedish Bureau of Statistics. The results show that SCI subjects, although provided with basic material commodities up to par with the general population, have less financial reserves and more frequently express worry about their finances. Less than half of the subjects are gainfully employed, when part-time jobs are also included. Social activities are more restricted, and more centered on the core social network. Several items in the survey point to a preoccupation with personal rather than public matters. We feel that these factors, at least to some degree, are consequential to separation from the workplace, with resulting disadvantageous financial and social effects. Intensified vocational rehabilitation efforts might thus be justified from both an economic and a psyche-social point of view.

An investigation of eight to eleven-year-old primary school children with the ''SOBEKI-Verfahren''	PRAXIS DER KINDERPSYCHOLOGIE UND KINDERPSYCHIATRIE			German	Article								From the beginning of their lifes children are involved in many different kinds of social relations, that influence the development of children's personality. With the ''Soziales Beziehungsverfahren'' (SOBEKI), a method for the clinical diagnostic of children is available, that allows of determining the social network of six- to twelve-year-olds as well as specific distributions of functions in the children's systems of relations and beyond, making conclusions about cohesion and hierarchical structures of children's networks in- and outside their families. In this article a study will be presented, in which the social relations of eight- to eleven-year-old primary school children were investigated with the SOBEKI.

A re-positioning of health and social care has taken place in the light of this pre-eminence of market forces with the assumption increasingly being made that potential service users operate on a 'level playing field' of opportunity. A major consequence has been the expansion of household health responsibilities through measures which include a greater emphasis on preventative screening and healthy lifestyles and a general shift in the locus of care to the 'community'. Not only has the last decade seen this intensification of pressure on women in their social role as family carers, a restructuring has taken place of the U.K. labour market such that the 'double burden' of paid and unpaid work is an increasingly common experience. Contrary to the policy view of equality of access, in-depth interview evidence from Liverpool shows that the health care behaviour of many women is increasingly constrained by their social roles and availability of economic and social network resources. This paper distinguishes between groups who are and are not well equipped to cope in the light of changing structures of provision and discusses the implications of the research for the design and implementation of health and social care.

While these studies acknowledge that rites of passage occur within particular physical spaces in which material objects are present, the importance of such objects has received little attention. I explore one particular role transition-moving away to college-and illustrate that objects play a central role in how students construct their identities. Students at ''Midwestern'' University make strategic choices about which objects to leave at home as anchors of prior identities and which ones to bring to school as markers of new identities. Moreover, I suggest that the meanings of these two categories of objects differ by gender. I argue that this case opens vp the possibility that objects play a much more central part in role transitions than social scientists have acknowledged. This study also challenges existing assumptions about different processes of identity formation. Therefore, it engenders the need for additional research about how people reinterpret objects during role transitions, and about the different meanings that objects may have for the constructions of masculinity and femininity.

Objective: To determine the prevalence of utilization by older adults and risk factors for APS. Methods: A longitudinal study using the New Haven Established Population for Epidemiologic Studies in the Elderly population, a cohort of 2812 community-dwelling adults who were older than 65 years in 1982. The main outcome measure was referral to the state ombudsman on aging for protective services. Results: Over the 11-year follow-up period, 209 cohort members (7.4%) were referred to the ombudsman 302 times as protective service cases for a community prevalence of 6.4% after adjusting for the sampling strategy of the cohort. Self-neglect was the most common indication for referral (73% of the cases). While in bivariate analyses a variety of baseline sociodemographic features, functional impairments, medical conditions, and social network factors were associated with APS use, in multivariable analysis only sociodemographic variables remained independent risk factors including low income (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 3.9), nonwhite race (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.7), and age older than 75 years at cohort inception (OR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0). Conclusions: Prevalence of APS use by older adults is substantial, and sociodemographic features were the most compelling risk factors in our cohort. As the population ages, the number of older adults at risk for abuse, neglect, self-neglect, exploitation, and abandonment will increase; physicians will need to become familiar with APS referral pathways and mandatory reporting laws in their states.

This paper reviews research findings on friend selection and projection to suggest that the magnitude of friend influence may be overestimated. This paper also observes that, although adolescent drug use is assumed to begin in response to peer group influence, peer groups have rarely been measured in studies of drug behavior.

Design: Cross-sectional study of MSM recruited from a variety of community settings. Methods: A total of 354 men agreed to participate after giving verbal informed consent. Information was obtained using a standardized questionnaire assessing demographics and AIDS-relevant information. Blood was obtained for HIV and syphilis testing. Results: Five main sexual identity groups emerged: cross dressers, homosexuals, gigolos, bisexuals and heterosexuals. Receptive anal and oral intercourse were commonly reported by men self-identifying as cross dressers or homosexuals, whereas nearly all of the remaining three groups practiced only insertive intercourse. Sexual contact with women was also commonly reported; overall, consistent condom use was infrequent. HIV antibodies were detected in 11.0% and serologic evidence of syphilis was found in 7.3%. Factors independently associated with HIV infection included serologic evidence of syphilis, having visited at least one of four local brothels in 1975-1985, and having had receptive anal intercourse with four or more partners in the last 12 months. Conclusions: Syphilis, sexual practices and social context of sex (commercial sex), rather than sexual identity per se, were associated with HIV infection. The complex social networks of MSM in this setting, the tendency to practice either insertive or receptive sex, but not both, infrequent condom use, high rates of syphilis and the frequency of sex with women need to be taken into account for targeted HIV prevention programs to be successful.

Forty-three research participants completed Life Chart Interviews covering their personal history since the onset of their psychiatric disorder. Participants appeared to be generally reliable informants on their treatment histories. They indicated that individual learning and personal choices influenced the course of the psychiatric disorder over time, including decisions about use of treatment and environmental support. These results support the value of life-context approach to research on severe mental illness. (C) 1996 by W.B.

To assess structural social network characteristics and perceived loneliness in fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) patients and healthy controls. Methods. A cross-sectional, retrospective, case-control design was employed using a structured interview and a self-report questionnaire. We studied 25 female FMS patients and 25 matched healthy female controls. Results. FMS patients had statistically significantly (P < 0.05) more intimate friends (mean 4.5) and more health care providers (mean 1.5) than did controls (2.3 and 0.0, respectively). The FMS patients more often initiated the contact with family members (mean 2.1) than did controls (mean 0.8). FMS patients did not perceive themselves as lonelier than controls perceived themselves. While there wets a significant negative correlation between loneliness and social network variables among the controls, this relationship was not significant among the FMS patients. Among the patients, there was a strong correlation between the total social network size and the number of intimate friends, whereas in controls, the mean number of acquaintances was strongly correlated with the total network size. Conclusion, Compared to healthy controls, the social networks of FMS patients presented more linkages with intimate friends, family members, and health care providers. The lack of correlation between loneliness and social network variables for FMS patients is not what might be expected from social support theory. The assessment of structural social network characteristics along with social support variables may add to our understanding of the social functioning of FMS patients.

Education groups for people with schizophrenia have tended to concentrate on compliance with medication. This study examines impact on social behaviour and quality of life. Method. A catchment-wide service was set up for community-based patients. Patients who indicated an interest in education groups were randomly allocated to either an education group or a waiting list control group. Those who attended groups were compared with the control group. Results. About one-quarter of community-based patients showed interest in attending education groups. Those who attended showed no change in mental state or compliance with medication (already high) but significant gains in quality of life, social functioning and social networks. Conclusions. For patients who choose to attend education groups significant gains in social functioning and quality of life are possible without specific skills training.

Design - The study is based on a cohort of primigravidas followed during pregnancy. Data were collected by self administered questionnaires during the pregnant womens) first antenatal visit at about 12 weeks. Setting - The study was performed in the antenatal clinics in the city of Malmo, Sweden. Participants - The participants were all primigravidas living in the city of Malmo, Sweden, over a one year period, 1991-92. A total of 872 (87.7%) of the 994 invited women agreed to participate. The population of this study on smoking includes all primigravidas who at the time of conception were smoking (n=404, 46.3%). Main results - At the first antenatal visit (63.6% (n=257) of the prepregnancy smokers were still smoking (a total smoking prevalence of 29.5%). The pregnant smokers were on average younger and had a lower educational level. The highest relative risk (RR) of continued smoking was found among unmarried women RR 2.7 (95% confidence interval) (1.5, 4.8), women having unplanned pregnancies RR 2.2 (1.2, 4.0) and those with a low social participation RR 1.6 (1.0, 2.7), low instrumental support RR 2.6 (1.2, 6.0), low support from the child's father RR 2.1 (1.0, 4.2) and those exposed to job strain RR= 2.3 (1.1,4.8). The associations were independent of potential confounders such as age, educational level, nationality, cohabiting status, passive smoking, and previous years of smoking. Conclusions - This study supports the stress hypothesis. Smoking can be one way women handle stress when demands become too great. In order to reduce smoking among pregnant women, maternity centre resources need to be focused more on women with low psychosocial resources who are at highest risk for continued smoking. It is also important to involve actively the woman's partner or other important people in the woman's social network.

The contributions of lesion characteristics, functional impairment, and psychosocial factors to the development of CAD after stroke were studied. Methods In a population-based cohort of 80 patients with acute stroke, we assessed GAD and comorbid major depression, functional ability, and social network at regular time points over 3 years. Cerebral atrophy and brain lesion parameters were determined from CT scans performed at the acute stage and after 3 years. Results The prevalence of GAD after stroke was 28% in the acute stage, and there was no significant decrease through the 3 years of follow-up. At 1 year, only 23% of the patients with early GAD (0 to 3 months) had recovered; those not recovered at this follow-up had a high risk of a chronic development of the anxiety disorder. Comorbidity with major depression was high and seemed to impair the prognosis of depression. At the acute stage after stroke, GAD plus depression was associated with left hemispheric lesion, whereas anxiety alone was associated with right hemispheric lesion. Cerebral atrophy was associated with both depression and anxiety disorder late but not early after stroke, Dependence in activities of daily living and reduced social network were associated with GAD at all follow-up periods except at the acute stage. Conclusions GAD after stroke is a common and longlasting affliction that interferes substantially with social life and functional recovery. There is a differentiation of factors implicated in its development based on the period of time since the stroke event.

While these models have been examined and debated from the perspective of ethnohistoric and linguistic data, relevant archaeological evidence has been lacking. This paper uses archaeological data on settlement patterns, lithic assemblage composition and the regional circulation of ceramics, metal, and other trade goods to demonstrate that the types of economic interactions suggested by the 'Interdependent' Model have existed between lowland agriculturalists and upland foragers in the Tanjay Region of the Central Philippines for at least the last 1500 years.

Single-parent families' purchase decisions, however, have not been studied in depth in the marketing discipline. This paper examines social network influence in terms of the role of marital status in purchase decisions. Of particular interest is the influence of social network members' input in the purchase decisions of single mothers. Propositions are considered and the implications for marketers, if these propositions prove to be true, are discussed.		Bates, MJ (reprint author), UNIV NEBRASKA,LINCOLN,NE 68588, USA.

A method is proposed to reveal and quantify communication networks as well as differences in the content of perceptions between organizational groups. In this way, a socio-cognitive configuration is created which can be used to identify and monitor hindrances in services innovation. Our approach, which is new to the field of services marketing, has been empirically tested in a project in which eight organizations cooperate in the development of a new information exchange service. Application of the social dynamic approach reveals an insight into the dynamics of service innovation projects. Implications for the management of these projects are discussed.

AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR			English	Article						direct and indirect aggression; social networks; gender differences	GENDER DIFFERENCES; SOCIAL NETWORK; LONELINESS	Most studies that report males as more aggressive than females have examined only direct aggression. However, recent research has shown that females may be more indirectly aggressive than males. Lagerspetz et al. [1988: Aggressive Behavior 14:403-414] have suggested that this gender difference in indirect aggression may arise because females have more dense networks than males, providing them with more opportunities for using indirect aggression. The present study examined the relationship between network density and aggression by administering self-report measures of each variable to 148 undergraduates. Males with high-density networks reported more indirect than direct aggression, and less direct aggression than males with low-density networks. Use of direct and indirect aggression by females was not related to network density. Explanations consider possible inhibitory and facilitating effects of network density. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

It is highly effective in engaging and retaining clients in inpatient treatment, but, since initial evaluations, two trends have emerged in the field. First. there has been an increase in the use of outpatient treatment and, second, a number of variations of the Johnson Intervention have been developed. The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of the Johnson Intervention with four other methods of referral to outpatient treatment. The other methods included two naturally occurring types of referral (coerced and noncoerced) and two less intense and less costly variations of the Intervention (Unrehearsed and Unsupervised). Effectiveness was determined by both entry into and completion of treatment. A retrospective study was conducted on a sample of 331 cases drawn from an alcohol and other drug treatment agency. Those who had undergone the Johnson Intervention were more likely to enter treatment than those in any of the four other groups. Of those that entered treatment, the Johnson Intervention and the coerced referral groups were equally likely to complete treatment, and both groups were more likely to complete treatment than those in the other three types of referral. Although the Johnson Intervention was the most effective, the variations did show some measure of success and can be viewed as part of an Intervention continuum.

Previously, we evaluated the effectiveness of the Johnson Intervention at engaging and retaining clients in outpatient alcohol and other drug (AOD) treatment by comparing it to four other methods of referral. Although individuals who undergo a Johnson Intervention are most likely to enter treatment, the power of the Johnson Intervention to retain clients deteriorates over the course of treatment, as indicated by their diminished likelihood of completing. Given that abstinence from alcohol and other drugs is one of the first expectations placed on clients, we compared the Johnson Intervention to the other types of referral to evaluate the role of relapse during treatment. In a secondary analysis of 210 cases, we found relapse rates across the five types of referral ranged From 38% to 79%. Those in the Johnson Intervention group were more likely to relapse than three of the four other groups and, across all groups, those who relapsed were less likely to complete treatment. In spite of its high relapse rate, the Johnson Intervention is very effective in retaining those who relapse because it is very effective retaining all clients, whether they relapse or not.

Such computer-supported social networks (CSSNs) are becoming important bases of virtual communities, computer-supported cooperative work, and telework. Computer-mediated communication such as electronic mail and computerized conferencing is usually text-based and asynchronous. It has limited social presence, and on-line communications are often more uninhibited, creative, and blunt than in-person communication. Nevertheless, CSSNs sustain strong, intermediate, and weak ties that provide information and social support in both specialized and broadly based relationships. CSSNs foster virtual communities that are usually partial and narrowly focused, although some do become encompassing and broadly based. CSSNs accomplish a wide variety of cooperative work, connecting workers within and between organizations who are often physically dispersed. CSSNs also link teleworkers from their homes or remote work centers to main organizational offices. Although many relationships function off-line as well as on-line, CSSNs have developed their own norms and structures. The nature of the medium both constrains and facilitates social control. CSSNs have strong societal implications, fostering situations that combine global connectivity, the fragmentation of solidarities, the de-emphasis of local organizations (in the neighborhood and workplace), and the increased importance of home bases.

This chapter presents an in-depth examination of the study of interlocking directorates. I focus initially on both the determinants and the consequences of interlocking directorates, reviewing alternative accounts of both phenomena. Special attention is paid to the processual formulations implied by various interlock analyses. I then address the two primary criticisms of interlock research and evaluate the tenability of these criticisms. I conclude with a discussion of future directions for interlock research.

Strategies compete against each other during each generation, and successful strategies contribute more of their attributes to the next generation. Each strategy is encoded on a 'chromosome' that plays the IPD, responding to the sequences of most recent responses by the interacting individuals (chromosomes). The analysis reported in this paper considered different memory capabilities (one to five previous interactions), pairing continuities (pairs of individuals remain together for about one, two, five, or 1000 consecutive interactions), and types of individual recognition (recognition capability was maximal, nil, or allowed to evolve between these limits). Analysis of the results focused on the frequency of mutual cooperation in pairwise interactions (a good indicator of overall success in the IPD) and on the extent to which previous responses by the focal individual and its partner were associated with the partner's identity (individual recognition). Results indicated that a fixed, substantial amount of individual recognition could maintain high levers of mutual cooperation even at low pairing continuities, and a significant but limited capability for individual recognition evolved under selection. Recognition generally increased mutual cooperation more when the recent responses of individuals other than the current partner were ignored. Titrating recognition memory under selection using a fitness cost suggested that memory of the partner's previous responses was more valuable than memory of the focal's previous responses. The dynamics produced to date by EvCo are a step toward understanding the evolution of social networks, for which additional benefits associated with group interactions must be incorporated.

This phase consisted of in-home interviews with 26 African-American (AF) and 26 Filipino-American (FA) parents who were not receiving counseling or social services for parent-child conflict, and self-reported adequate personal and family functioning. In general, parents were college educated and employed full-time and had household incomes of over $25,000. On average, AF parents were 35 years old, with 4 people in the household, including 2 children (mean age = 10 years). FA parents were older, averaging 45 years, and had 6 people in the household, including 3 children (mean age = 12 years). Mean scores on standardized measures reflected high self-esteem and positive attitudes toward their children and families. Social network size averaged 32 and 38 members for AF and FA mothers respectively, and 24 and 29 members for AF and FA fathers. Most parents reported that fewer than 50% of their network members knew each other. Data also suggested that parents reported a generally positive orientation to utilizing support resources, and favorable perceptions of and satisfaction with support form family and friends. Analyzes revealed that only functional support variables were significantly associated with parent well-being. Study limitations, service implications, and further research directions are discussed.

Interviews with aliens, smugglers and law enforcement officials in China, Hong Kong and the U.S. reveal this activity to be a complex process comprising a number of distinct operational stages. Our data suggest Chinese alien smuggling groups vary in their level of organization but most are best understood as task forces, or small groups of people assembled to perform a particular piece of work. These task forces are typically linked to international social networks characterized by overlapping, dyadic relationships; a high level of role differentiation; and a limited degree of hierarchy. Such groups are highly responsive to changing socio-legal and market constraints.

This study was designed to test whether recall of parental rearing (Parental Bonding Instrument), perception of relationship with partner (Dyadic Adjustment Scale) and Social Support (Mannheim interview of Social Support) differs significantly between two groups of women: one with non bipolar affective disorder (DSM III R) compared with another (control) of healthy women from a primary practice setting. A relationship with low mother-child affection, a dyadic relationship mainly characterized by poor cohesion and low everyday psychological support from the social network were the risk factors that best differentiated depressed women from those in the control group.

Conflict over infant caregiving characterized families who demonstrated an ethic of adversarial care. In contrast, families with a responsive ethic attended to the mother and baby without taking over and shared caregiving in a high fluid manner. In articulating the experiential worlds of family members, this study describes their situated possibilities as the basis for developing clinical practices that promote responsive caregiving.

We investigate the effect of the layout of a social network on the inferences drawn by observers about the number of social groupings evident and the centrality of various actors in the network. We conducted an experiment in which eighty subjects provided answers about three drawings. The subjects were not told that the drawings were chosen from five different layouts of the same graph. We found that the layout has a significant effect on their inferences and present some initial results about the way certain Euclidean features will affect perceptions of structural features of the network, There is no ''best'' layout for a social network; when layouts are designed one must take into account the most important features of the network to be presented as well as the network itself.

Organizations have made strides in complying with such policies through their hiring practices and in employee development and training programmes. While laws such as the Civil Rights Act and programmes such as EEO and AA have high aims and lofty claims, in practice they miss the mark in organizations. Research indicates that the nature of the work relationship is constrained by both network and hierarchical forms of organization. Suggests that policy is predicated only on the latter and that innovation may lie in the former. Finds that understanding and managing the networks in organizations may be used to augment existing programmes in achieving non-discriminatory or ''fair'' employment practices.

Subjects were street recruited between July 1991 and January 1993, were interviewed about their risk behaviors in the prior 2 years and their personal risk networks with other IDUs in the prior 30 days, and were tested for HIV; 20% were HIV seropositive. Among those who both shared syringes and had a personal risk network member who injected more than once a day, 40% were HIV seropositive (versus 14% for others, p < 0.001). In simultaneous multiple logistic regression, the interaction of both sharing syringes and having a personal risk network member who injected more than once a day remained independently and significantly associated with being HIV seropositive (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.22, 10.43; p < 0.020), along with Latino race/ethnicity and exchanging sex for money or drugs. These findings suggest that the combination of sharing syringes with having a high-risk personal network is a risk factor for HIV infection among new IDUs. Studies of risk factors for HIV infection among new IDUs and interventions to reduce the spread of HIV among them should focus on their risk networks as well as their risk behaviors.

Previous studies have revealed that there exist different types of social networks and that identifying network type and available informal support is important for planning effective service delivery. The main focus of this investigation was on the structure and characteristics of informal support networks and the pattern of support that occurred. The sample consisted of 32 individuals with an intellectual disability, mean age 46.7 years. Overall, the study found that carers received little support from other family members and the wider community in performing personal and household care tasks. The informal networks of older adults with learning disability operated on a hierarchical basis with primary family members, particularly parents and siblings, providing the bulk of informal support. Other relatives and friends and neighbours played a less significant role in informal care networks. The study also draws attention to the increasing number of elderly carers who, often single-handedly, provide the primary sources of care for older adults with learning disability. Contrary to what might be expected, it was found that the size of an individual's network, in terms of numbers of localised kin members, was not related to the amount of support the main carer received from others.

In the literature, several attempts have been made to describe characteristics of nodes, links, and of the overall structure of such systems. However, the utility of these attempts is only limited for educational purposes because most of them are uneconomic in measuring and almost none of them is explicitly concerned with learning. In this article, an analogy between information networks and social networks is established. This analogy is used to illustrate the application of standard network analysis procedures. These procedures are available in widespread PC software (e.g., UCINET) and are used for calculating indices mapping structural aspects of hypermedia systems which are hypothesized to be relevant for learning. It is shown how the graphical representation of a hypothetical hypermedia system can be transformed into a matrix format which functions as the basis for computing standard network indices for nodes, groups of nodes, and entire networks (e.g., among others, centrality, cliques, or path distances). For each index, its potential influence on learning processes or learning outcomes is discussed. Implications of using standard network indices for research and practice in the field of educational or instructional hypermedia systems are outlined.

The extent to which a lesbian community can meet the needs of individual lesbians is dependent on what those needs are, the prevailing social climate, and the resulting degree of access by lesbians to the community. This study examined lesbians' perceptions of their individual needs and the extent to which they looked to their community to meet those needs. Overall, the results indicated that lesbians in Brisbane had many unmet needs which, in many instances, cut across the demographic spectrum of age, politics, stage of identity development, religious beliefs, occupation, and educational achievements. These can be broadly categorized as needs that related to the lesbian community itself and external needs that related to changes needed in heterosexual society. The results of this study indicated that characteristics of community do exist within the Brisbane lesbian subculture. There were distinct, identifiable, interacting small groups and social networks in existence. However, a common need was for an identifiable, accessible, lesbian community that could provide stable, long-term services and cultural and social activities. In Brisbane lesbians also needed a focus that superseded the needs of individual lesbians and their small interacting social networks. This study highlighted the need for further research into the area of lesbian community identity formation.

The exchange model predicts higher compliance in cohesive networks with strong social ties. However, previous specifications failed to incorporate bilateral exchange of approval. Computer simulations using a Bush-Mosteller stochastic learning model show that bilateral exchanges evolve more readily than multilateral, causing social control to flow into the maintenance of interpersonal relationships at the expense of compliance with group obligations, a structural form of the ''second-order free-rider problem.''

Our interest lies in the kind of social networks that these models produce. We ask the question of whether such models produce ''interesting'' structure from a network point-of-view, in particular, from the perspective of Holland and Leinhardt who argue that any network that can be modeled adequately using only properties of nodes and dyads has no social structure. We show that E-state structuralism models are models of social structure in this technical sense because they assume a bystander mechanism in the creation of ties.

A comparative analysis of dynamic access models in policy networks	JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL SOCIOLOGY			English	Article						policy networks; collective decision making; computer simulation; object-oriented modeling; dynamic modeling of social networks		In policy networks actors use access relations to influence preferences of other actors. Establishment and shifts of access relations and their consequences for outcomes of decisions are the main focal points in this paper. Unlike most policy network studies, we therefore do not take the network and its relations as given and constant. Instead we device computer simulation models to account for the dynamics in policy networks. We compare different models and investigate the resulting network structures and predicted outcomes of decisions. The choice among the alternative models is made by their correspondence with empirical network structures and actual outcomes of decisions. In our models, we assume that all relevant actors aim at policy outcomes as close as possible to their own preferences. Policy outcomes are determined by the preferences df the final decision makers at the moment of the vote. In general, only a small fraction of the actors takes part in the final vote. Most actors have therefore to rely on access relations for directly or indirectly shaping the preferences of the final decision makers. For this purpose actors make access requests to other actors. An access relation is assumed to be established if such a request is accepted by the other actor. Access relations require time and resources. Actors are therefore assumed to be restricted in the number of access requests they can make and the number of requests they can accept Moreover, due to incomplete information and simultaneous actions by other actors, actors have to make simplifying assumptions in the selection of their ''best'' requests and learn by experience. We device two base models that correspond to two basic views on the nature of political processes. In the first view politics is seen as power driven. Corresponding to this view, actors aim at access relations with the most powerful actors in the field. They estimate their likelihood of success by comparing their own resources with those of the target actors. Power also determines the order in which actors accept requests. In the second view, policy matters and actors roughly estimate the effects access relations might have on the outcome of decisions. Actors select requests to ''bolster'' their own preference as much as possible. We will show that these base models and some intermediate ones result in fundamentally different network structures and predicted outcomes. Moreover, we will show that the policy driven models do fundamentally better than the power driven models.

Data matrices which represent the perceived relationships between members of a social network are used to construct a (possibly infinite) data semigroup of derived relations defined by (real) matrix multiplication. This complex structure is analyzed by forming interaction semigroups. These semigroups are homomorphic images of the data semigroup. The corresponding congruences are generated by identifying products of finite order which are highly positively correlated. Several methods of generating the interaction semigroups are examined and are shown to generate nonhomomorphic semigroups. For each congruence, an associated triple of numbers can be defined which may serve as an indicator of the validity and/or a measure of the stability of the semigroup model. A series of hypothetical examples is developed to study how the algebraic properties of interaction semigroups reflect and uncover properties of associated networks. Specifically, relationships between homogeneity of a network and the algebraic structure of the corresponding interaction semigroup are addressed. The applicability of the above techniques to blockmodels is demonstrated.		Barnes, GR (reprint author), UNIV LOUISVILLE,DEPT MATH,LOUISVILLE,KY 40292, USA.

Other related techniques from the literature are more appropriate for analysis of sociomatrices. The different approaches are used to analyze a familiar sociomatrix, and the results of the techniques are compared.

In particular, this is done by analyzing a further attempt, as recently suggested by Braun (1993 and 1994), to extend the well-known Coleman Model by incorporating the embeddedness of social transactions in incomplete social network structures. ''Pars pro toto'' it is proved that Braun's conceptualization contains some weaknesses which imply that fundamental conclusions drawn in his article have to be revised.

However, because of their interpersonal style, many patients high in dependency have difficulties establishing and maintaining close interpersonal relationships. The present study examined interpersonal problems related to the dependent personality disorder. The relationships between dependency and interpersonal problems were examined in 43 adult psychiatric inpatients and 66 nonpatient adults. All subjects were assessed for social functioning in terms of social behaviors typically displayed, density of their social networks, and subjective feelings of loneliness. Using correlations and multiple regression analyses, results showed that dependency was closely related to social behavior and quality of social networks for both psychiatric inpatients and nonpatient controls. Pearson correlations showed the dependent personality style was related to negative and disruptive interpersonal behaviors. Also, measures of social functioning were related to feelings of loneliness and depression. Finally, interpersonal dependency was strongly related to both depressive symptoms and depressive attitudes, especially in the psychiatric inpatients. The present findings demonstrate the importance of interpersonal dependency as related to interpersonal problems.

A twenty-three question multidimensional instrument measures three social network dimensions: relationship depth, conflict, and perceived contact. Convergent validity, divergent validity, and reliability of the GSNM was evaluated. The sample of 129 adults included fifty-six individuals from a psychiatric clinic, fifty college housing employees, and twenty-three graduate students.

Family conflict and peer deviance were significant predictors of injection frequency and illegal activity during treatment, and reductions in family conflict were associated with lower drug use, injection frequency, and illegal activity during treatment These results provide support for treatment emphasis on helping clients reduce conflict among family members, improve dysfunctional relationships with peers, and replace deviant friendships with others that encourage treatment participation and conformance to social norms.

This paper questions how such a notion may apply to women in a nursing home setting and contrasts women's experiences with those of men. It is a reanalysis of data from a previously reported study of institutionalized elders' social networks, this time with a specific focus on women residents' relationships with one another. Here, I consider the role of negative interaction in personal relationships, the meaning of intimacy and reciprocity in the nursing home context, and issues of age and gender. The final section, implications for practice and future research, includes a discussion of the opportunities for and constraints on relationship formation.

While it refers in this context especially to the former elite of the Socialist Unity Party (SED)/Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) in the process of transformation, it has now been extended to certain types of informal social relations aiming at social advancement even by using partly illegal methods. To such an extent the term ''rope-teams'' describes social networks of a special quality They are only explainable by means of a long-term examination of behaviour. This special type of social relationship is illustrated with the help of a prime example, which resulted from an intensive and long-standing participant observation by the authors. In the centre of the examination there are processes and techniques which serve to protect and extend power and status opportunities not least by exchanging power resources within the structure of formal organizations and/or institutions. To a certain extent rope-teams are reflecting the survival of reciprocity oriented primitive behaviour patterns.

In the light of an ongoing fishery crisis in Lofoten, a mental health promotion project ''Liv Laga i Lofoten'' was planned. The theoretical basis of the ''Liv Laga'' model for mental health promotion is the interaction of recent strain situations, support from social networks, and personal resources; within a local community framework. The level of social integration-disintegration of the local community is dealt with both theoretically and in practice. The design of ''Liv Laga i Lofoten'' was developed through a process bringing the psychiatric out-patient clinic, the municipal health and social services, and local politicians together to secure local ownership and identification with the project. A main feature of the project work is the combination of close engagement, participation in planning and practical work, and the use of a scientific model as a continuous basis for understanding and implementation. External resources must be baked into local social networks, and programmes must emerge from locally felt needs. Structures of leadership and cooperation must always be an integral part of a community mental health project.

The definition will be influenced by values and points of reference. Not at least in the psychiatric domain we need a precise and not to wide-ranging definition. If we are to investigate the relation between living conditions or different psychiatric diagnoses, and people's subjective experience, we have to separate these sets of phenomena. Quality of life is related to individual feelings. It is subjective and includes a global assessment. It is seen as both a cognitive evaluation and some degree of positive and negative feelings. It correlates with depression but can be separated from it. Personality factors will influence quality of life, but it reacts to life changes and cannot be seen as synonymous with any particular trait. Quality of life measurements have shown that long-term psychiatric patients have lower well-being than others. They can also help us to weigh between different treatment programmes, and between patients and their social network.

The psychiatric teams responsible for the treatment of the patients conducted detailed, standardized interviews with the patients at entry and at the end of the 1st, 2nd, and 5th year. Changes in patients' social network were analysed in accordance with their family situation. Men more often lived with their parents and less often with a spouse than women; additionally, men had a tendency to move from living with a spouse to living with parents or outside family, while women showed the opposite tendency. Recovery of social networks was most prominent among patients who were living with their spouse. Instead, patients living outside families often lost their social contacts during follow-up. For patients living with their parents changes in social network were mainly explained by a selective migration of patients back to living with their parents. Family environment can be of great importance to schizophrenia patients in their social recovery from psychosis. At the same time, however, the families of schizophrenia patients need support from the psychiatric treatment system. Patients living outside families - and men in particular - are at great risk of losing their social contacts and therefore need network therapy.

Data about forty-three support group participants and forty-two nonparticipants and their deceased children were obtained through questionnaires and telephone interviews. Over 76 percent of nonparticipants were found to have lost their child after a period of anticipatory grief while 80 percent of participants lost their child suddenly or without adequate forewarning. Having adequate support in their immediate environment was the reason stated by most for not joining a group. The majority of group participants mentioned that they needed a place to share grief with other bereaved parents even though their family and friends were supportive. It appears that bereaved parents are more likely to join a support group when they experience a particularly traumatic loss and do not find others who have suffered a similar loss in their usual social network.

Methods: Long-stay patients (that is, those with stays of at least one year) who were discharged from two psychiatric hospitals in London were closely matched with patients likely to stay in the hospital for another year Baseline (in-hospital) and one-year follow-up assessments were conducted using six instruments to measure factors related to quality of life such as problems in social functioning and size of the social network. Results: A total of 494 discharged patients were compared with 279 patients who remained in the hospital. The death rate did not differ between the two groups. Only six discharged patients became vagrants, and only two were imprisoned, one briefly discharged patients were living under much less restrictive conditions, they preferred their life in the community, and the number of their friends increased, as did the number of acquaintances in the community such as neighbors. No adverse effects of discharge on mental state or social behavior were noted. Conclusions: The results indicate that community care is a beneficial alternative to longterm care in psychiatric hospitals for the majority of patients, provided it is well planned and adequate resources are available.

Mediating factors	PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE			English	Article							SOCIAL SUPPORT; LIFE EVENTS; PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDER; DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS; REARING BEHAVIOR; CHILDHOOD; PERSONALITY; STRESS; VULNERABILITY; RISK	Potential mediators of the modest association between retrospectively rated parental behaviour and adult affective symptoms in offspring were investigated in a national longitudinal study of a cohort followed to the age of 43. Personality measures from adolescence could account for a small part of this association. Personal relationships in adulthood were more strongly associated with both parental behaviour and symptoms: marital history, emotional support, social network and availability of help in a crisis. Poor parenting did not lead to a general vulnerability to later life events, and socio-economic status and financial hardship were not implicated in the link between parental behaviour and adult symptoms. However, parental affectionless control was associated with certain types of life stressors in adulthood, i.e. interpersonal as opposed to non-interpersonal life events. Collectively, aspects of personal relationships accounted for much of the elevated symptom levels in those rating parents as low on care or high on control. Findings were consistent with the notion that interpersonal competence is important in the continuity between childhood experience and adult mental health, but other possible interpretations are discussed.

The investigation is part of a longitudinal study involving 39 children and their families. We developed a network game for children in order to assess self-report data on children's social networks at the age of six and nine. These findings indicate that only a few complex network measures, e.g. the number of older peers and the number of opposite-sex friends, correlate meaningfully with the child's competence as rated by parents and teachers. When those children, who overestimated the number of their friends, were excluded from data analysis, we obtained even more significant correlations. Children whose mothers made special efforts to encourage children's social contacts reported fewer peer relations and scored lower on social competence. Thus, their mothers seem to respond to deficits they perceived in their children's social development. Only children whose mothers showed a high degree of empathy when arranging opportunities for peer contact were found to be more competent, and they included more older peers in their social networks. Longitudinal data show that this maternal empathy is embedded in a generally harmonious family climate.

Children were asked to mention all the persons who are important to them, and to rate these persons on dimensions of perceived social support and conflict. In a telephone interview, parents were also asked to mention the persons important to their child, and to estimate the time their child spent with these persons. Parents tended to underestimate the number of friends in their child's social network. The larger the discrepancy, the lower the parent is rated by the child on perceived social support. For perceived social support, mothers and fathers were the highest providers, followed by peers and siblings, The largest amount of conflict was reported with siblings, followed by peers, and then by both parents. Perceived support tended to co-occur within the family, but less so between family and peer group. Structural features of the network were not related to children's self-worth. Low support from mother, father, and peers was related to low self-worth, and children with low parental support and low peer support seem to be double at risk. These results illustrate the importance of social relationships for children, and the advantages of studying these relationships within a social network approach.

Besides, parents and their friends can serve as models for children's social behavior. Because of parents' friendships with other parents their very young children can be in contact on a regular basis. in these ways a foundation for children's social integration is formed. Second- to fifth-graders (N = 116) and their parents were asked about their social networks. Additionally, data about children's concepts of friendship were gathered. The more friendships their parents maintained, the more friends outside the classroom were nominated by their children and the more reciprocated close friendships inside the classroom the fourth- and fifth-graders had. The more friends were nominated by parents, the more developed were children's concepts of friendship.

Sexual offenders are often considered to be loners who offend in isolation, but cases of sex crimes involving peer support are not difficult to find, e.g., child sex rings, gang rapes. To examine the role of peers in sexual offending, sexual offenders and nonsexual offenders were asked whether they knew other people who have committed sexual crimes. In comparison to the nonoffender community comparison group, the sexual offenders reported considerably more association and identification with sexual offenders. The associations also tended to be offence specific, such that child molesters knew other child molesters and rapists knew other rapists. These findings have important implications for the assessment and treatment of sexual offenders.

One method of ''outreach'' is based on the recruitment of networks of community members (or ''networkers'') to deliver HIV prevention messages and materials in the context of their social networks and everyday lives. This paper documents the experiences of the AIDS Community Demonstration Projects in recruiting networkers to deliver HIV prevention interventions to high-risk populations, including injecting drug users not in treatment; female sex partners of injecting drug users; female sex traders; men who have sex with men but do not self-identify as gay; and youth in high-risk situations. The authors interviewed project staff and reviewed project records of the implementation of community networks in five cities. Across cities, the projects successfully recruited persons into one or more community networks to distribute small media materials, condoms, and bleach kits, and encourage risk-reduction behaviors among community members. Networkers' continuing participation was enlisted through a variety of monetary and nonmonetary incentives. While continuous recruitment of networkers was necessary due to attrition, most interventions reported maintaining a core group of networkers. In addition, the projects appeared to serve as a starting point for some networkers to become more active in other community events and issues.

Fifteen individuals with intellectual disabilities participated in an analysis of the relationship between their social skills (as measured via the Scales of Independent Behavior and the Assessment of Social Competence) and the stability of the social relationships they experienced with other community members, who were neither paid staff nor family members, across the course of 94 consecutive weeks. A participant's social skills did a moderately good job of predicting the average social stability achieved by all of his or her social network members, but a poorer job of predicting the average social stability achieved by the participant's three most stable social network members. The findings suggest that the stability of a participant's most stable social network members is based not on the participant's social skills, but rather on other factors.

They have a relatively poor quality of life and endoscopic findings can only explain symptoms in about half of these patients. Thus psychosocial factors which could contribute to their morbidity should be explored. While some studies have methodological shortcomings, main findings are that key psychological factors are anxiety, tension, neuroticism, somatization, fears of malignancy, negative assessment of health, depression, a poor social network and less effective coping strategies. Physical illness is likely to bring on psychological distress due to discomfort or threat of ill health. Cognizance of psychosocial factors will facilitate an understanding of the underlying problems and will improve diagnosis and selection of optimal treatment.

Disease control efforts can he enchanced by incorporating network concepts overtly into current practices, Such concepts offer a path to better delineation of groups at risk, to a better understanding of the interaction of personal risk taking and the social contest, and to evaluation of control mechanisms.

The subjects were 138 Chinese 4th grade students (mean age = 9.91) from a primary school and 167 Chinese 7th grade students (mean age = 13.09) from a secondary school, both located in Hong Kong. Following the Social Cognitive Map (SCM) procedure, students were asked to identify the social groups within their grades, including their own groups. The subjects also rated themselves on multiple domains of competence. Their teachers rated them on the same domains. Subjects tended to be biased toward self-enhancement when reporting their own groups: They omitted members who had low school scholastic rank and unfavorable scores on teacher ratings of competence. There was a strong effect of propinquity and gentler on group membership, in that all groups were comprised of children from the same classroom and virtually all (98%) of the same sex. Members scored similarly on teacher ratings of competence. In elementary school, conventional values and academic achievement provided the behavioral bases for peer group cohesion. By early adolescence, peer-related concerns supplemented rather than replaced conventional values as the bases for group cohesion.

Traditional methods of sociometric ratings or assessments of friendship choices are not intended to identify reciprocal influences in children's peer groups of social interrelationships. In the study of networks within sociology, researchers have focused on the structural properties of children's networks, instead of the psychologically meaningful characteristics of the children who comprise a target child's network. To complement these strategies, a method is presented that can reliably identify those individuals who constitute children's natural peer groups in a setting. This information is used to form composite maps that represent the psychological peer context of a given child. Strategies are outlined for analyzing processes of group selection and socialization among developing individuals and their changing peer contexts.

Elementary school students nominated classmates for aggressivity, disruptiveness, popularity, studiousness, leadership, cooperativeness, athleticism, and shyness. Students had 1 of 4 levels of network centrality (i.e., nuclear, secondary, peripheral, isolated) and were in 1 of 4 educational classifications (i.e., academically gifted, emotionally and behaviorally disordered, general education, learning disabled), Across educational classifications for both boys and girls, nuclear students were athletic, cooperative, leaders, popular, and studious relative to lower centrality students. However, antisocial characteristics were associated with lower centrality for girls only. Aggressive behavior was positively associated with nuclear centrality for general education boys. Findings are considered in relation to sociometric status research and implications of the role of social network centrality in the establishment and maintenance of antisocial behavior are discussed.

Semi-structured interviews were conducted individually with the youth and repeated following a four-week interval. Record data were reviewed to assess behavioral adjustment, The Social Cognitive Map analytic technique was utilized to identify social clusters. Findings indicate that these extremely delinquent youth formed reasonably stable social networks within the institution. Social clusters were distinguished most strongly on the basis of gender, race and proximity. Individuals within clusters had similar levels of behavioral adjustment and perceptions of intimacy with peers. The processes of peer group formation are similar to those found among public school counterparts. Treatment implications are discussed.

While such inconsistencies may be expected in relationships such as giving advice and lending money, they are rarely expected to occur in seemingly symmetric relationships such as friendship. Nevertheless, they do. We suggest that research in this area has been hampered by the confused language used for describing 'symmetries' and 'non-symmetries'. We present a framework for thinking about these relations that clearly distinguishes cognitive inconsistencies and non-symmetric and non-reciprocated, relations. Then, we employ this framework and constructural theory to suggest that owing to cognitive inconsistencies, any interaction-based relationship, including friendship, can potentially be non-symmetric. We examine a series of hypotheses concerning interaction and interaction-based behaviors that derive from this theory using friendship relations. We find that we are able to predict both who is friends with whom, non-symmetry in friendship, and non-reciprocities in the expectation for and recall of friendship.

The present paper creates a social network threshold model of the diffusion of innovations based on the Ryan and Gross (1943) adopter categories: (1) early adopters; (2) early majority; (3) late majority; (4) laggards. This new model uses social networks as a basis for adopter categorization, instead of solely relying on the system-level analysis used previously. The present paper argues that these four adopter categories can be created either with respect to the entire social system, or with respect to an individual's personal network. This dual typology is used to analyze three diffusion datasets to show how external influence and opinion leadership channel the diffusion of innovations. Network thresholds can be used (1) to vary the definition of behavioral contagion, (2) to predict the pattern of diffusion of innovations, and (3) to identify opinion leaders and followers in order to understand the two-step flow hypothesis better.

Results indicate that family support is a primary source of patient support and that the impact of illness on families is substantial, underscoring their need for support. Results also indicate that there are numerous opportunities for problematic supportive exchange within families. The case is made that future studies of social support are needed to answer a series of questions about social support process within families coping with serious illness.

I begin to develop this generic method through a specific application. Reformulating Blau's (1964) model of social exchange to reflect the dynamic nature of interaction and the accompanying potential for opportunistic behavior, I demonstrate how social exchange may be formalized as a repeated game, and how game-theoretic models may be used to predict the stability of particular exchange network structures. The specific application offers some evidence of the fruitfulness of the generic theoretical method, providing an explanation for the strong, reciprocal relationships in the workgroup advice network observed by Blau (1955).

Given the marginal position of this topic in Czech sociology, she first examines Anglo-Saxon sociological literature, enumerates those subjects which are currently the centre of interest in sociological and social gerontological research: 1. the congruency of parents and adult children, 2. interaction between the two generations, identification of the causes of their conflicts, 3. the importance of socialisation towards kinship responsibility, 4. the motivation of mutual help and aid, 5. the types of expected family support and actual support behaviour, 6. changes in the nature of exchanged sources and the direction of their flow throughout the life cycle, the alternative sources in its particular phase, 7. the consequences of a divorce on intergenerational relations within the family, 8. social networks of childless people in older age groups etc. From among theoretical concepts the author identifies equity, obligation and attachment theories as well as the concepts of identity, salience and crescive bonds. She adds to them the concept of family/kinship solidarity which, from an empirical point of view, is very supportive and which can be integrated with the abovementioned theories. The article concludes with a select bibliography.		Sykorova, D (reprint author), UNIV PALCKEHO,FILOZOFICKA FAK,WURNOVA 7,CR-77180 OLOMOUC,CZECH REPUBLIC.

People should be offered such forms of dying and death that fit their cosmology and views of the good life and death. Not believing in a Life after corporal death means emphasising everyday life and social networks. The paper has four themes: 1) The tendency to conceal and deny death as an existential condition of life needs to be analysed and questioned. 2) Dying and death are sequestrated in modern society and should be brought together with everyday Life. 3) The medical control and steering of the dying process is based on some evaluative presumption that needs to be elucidated and discussed. 4) Human sciences should give more attention to the social consequences of death and the shaping of such institutional rites of passage from living to dead that consoles, reliefs, confirms, reconciles, reintegrates and supports the immediately involved.

In this article, they criticize the literature for its failure to come to grips with observable differences in parents' and guardians' educational skills, occupational and economic flexibility, social networks, and positions of power that they bring to home-school encounters. They illustrate their concerns with examples from a study that used ethnographic methods to explore the family-school relationships of White and African American children in third and fourth grade and conclude by discussing the implications for educational policy.

Such research has been used for many years in drugs research, but during the AIDS epoch its practical application has been most fully realised. Data are presented to illustrate the way in which qualitative research can inform the development of outreach initiatives targeted towards illicit drug injectors, not in contact with treatment services. Social networks of injectors from three sites in England were studied and we describe the strategies they adopted to reduce the likelihood of viral infection. We show how informal coping strategies, such as personalising syringes and ensuring a supply of sterile injecting equipment through secondary distribution can be integrated into peer education outreach. We also examine the management of risk and the social meanings that perpetuate sharing of injecting equipment, describe situations and scenarios in which syringe sharing is likely to occur, and suggest how such research can assist the evaluation and evolution of relevant and targeted interventions.

The following study explored whether a model predicting drinking from religious denominations through a series of intervening cognitive and social variables (drinking attitudes and norms, social contexts, social networks, and home use of alcohol) would be the same for Blacks and Whites. The results showed that there are a number of racial differences in how religious background influences intervening social characteristics, but few in the predictors of drinking behavior.

An overview of recent research shows the majority of drug injectors to be sexually active, low levels of reported condom use, a significant minority of female injectors to be involved in prostitution, relatively high levels of sexual mixing between drug injectors and noninjectors, and only scant indications of sexual behavior change. Epidemiological studies of risk, however, are unable to yield the data required to understand the interaction between individual risk behavior and social relationships. This is required if obstacles to safer sex compliance and sexual behavior change are to be overcome, and demands recognition of the influence and importance of social context on the production of sexual risk behavior in future research and intervention designs. In response, the paper explores the future role of qualitative research in understanding the social relations of ''risk'' and in contributing toward theoretical advancements in explanations of risk perception and risk behavior. The paper concludes by discussing the implications of this analysis for developing interventions which aim to target social relationships as agents of social network and community change.

Economic changes are particularly marked in the Baltic region which affects, above all, the German Baltic seaports, The two large container ports of Hamburg and Bremen/Bremerhaven are primarily faced with economic and technical-organisational changes in intercontinental container transport, Restructuring of the ports is currently governed by an adjustment of port infrastructures to the changed requirements of transport and services, and an extension of hinterland relations. Changes in the institutional and financial structures of German ports are Likely in view of the chronic crisis situations of public budgets and the attempts of the European Commission to apply the principle of spreading costs fairly to all European ports, on the basis of standardised cost recording and accounting. The introduction of containers resulted in spiralling labour productivity, with a consequent loss in jobs in the operative core area of the port economy, In view of this forced logistic structural change ports become 'container floodgates', a 'logistic channel' through which cargo passes. Most port regions are attempting to counteract the job decline in the operative function sector carried out by the seaport through developing the services offered towards ''value-added logistics''. The functional changes of ports modify economic linkages of ports and regions, The immediate Linkages of ports and sea-oriented industries are decreasing and differentiated economic and social networks are emerging in the shape of transport and logistic service centres, although their interlinked relations are no longer one-sidedly port-based.

A discriminant function analysis was performed using measures of life adversity, psychological distress, an psychosocial resources. The best combination of predictors for distinguishing between HIV+ women and gay men was comprised of satisfaction with emotional support, network size, use of avoidant coping, Hamilton depression, and loneliness scores [Chi(2)(7)=14.8, p<.05]. Women reported more satisfaction with emotional support, although gay men had larger social networks. Gay men used more avoidant coping and had higher loneliness scores as compared to women, although women reported more depressive symptoms. Utilizing this set of psychosocial variables, we correctly classified 73% of the HIV+ women and 67% of the HIV+ men. These findings suggest the importance of considering subgroup differences in the design of counseling programs for HIV+ individuals.

Contrary to an abridged and overgeneralized public, political and scientific discussion, one can, by no means, assume a decrease in family functions concerning the aged. It seems that in some areas emotional and instrumental functions of the family increase. In other areas functions are transferred and generally there is a whole new division of labor between family and other informal networks. These informal networks are obviously becoming increasingly meaningful in the sense of a family ''freely chosen''. Because of considerable variability in social structure generalizations in this area cannot be made. On the whole, one can expect a continuing expansion and differentiation in the range and type of support offered the elderly by the family and other networks.

First, the results indicate variations of network size by age, family status and gender: older, single and female participants have smaller networks than younger, married and male participants. Second, elderly migrants often have large sociability networks, but with regard to instrumental and emotional support the interviewed elderly migrants only can dispose of a few, mainly close family network members. Finally, a strong orientation of the elderly migrants to persons of their own ethnic group could be observed: with regard to all types of social support a distinct superiority of intraethnic relationships was found. Considering the predicted overburdening and reduction of the ethnic family-oriented support networks of the elderly migrants, the socio-political system must provide appropriate measures.
